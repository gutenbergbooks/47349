<h2 class="p2">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="pn2">When I began, some years ago, to plead the cause of the innumerable
hardy flowers against the few tender ones, put out
at that time in a formal way, the answer frequently was, “We
cannot go back to the mixed border”&mdash;that is to say, the old
way of arranging flowers in borders. Knowing, then, a little
of the vast world of plant beauty quite shut out of our
gardens by the “system,” in vogue, I was led to consider the
ways in which it might be introduced to our gardens; and,
among various ideas that then occurred to me, was the name
and scope of the “wild garden.” I was led to think of the
enormous number of beautiful hardy plants from other
countries which might be naturalised, with a very slight
amount of trouble, in many situations in our gardens and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
woods&mdash;a world of delightful plant beauty that we might in
this way make happy around us, in places now weedy, or half
bare, or useless. I saw that we could not only grow thus a
thousandfold more lovely flowers than are commonly seen in
what is called the flower garden, but also a number which,
by any other plan, have no chance whatever of being seen
around us. This is a system which will give us more
beauty than ever was dreamt of in gardens, without interfering
with formal gardening in any way.</p>

<p>In this illustrated edition, by the aid of careful drawings,
I have endeavoured to suggest in what the system consists;
but if I were to write a book for every page that this contains,
I could not hope to suggest the many beautiful aspects of
vegetation which the wild garden will enable us to enjoy at
our doors.</p>

<p>The illustrations are, with a few slight exceptions, the
work of Mr. Alfred Parsons, and the drawing and engraving
have been several years in execution. They are after
nature, in places where the ideas expressed in the first small
edition of the book had been carried out, or where accident,
as in the case of the beautiful group of Myrrh and white
Harebells, had given rise to the combinations or aspects of
vegetation sought. I cannot too heartily acknowledge the
skill and pains which Mr. Parsons devoted to the drawings,
and to the success which he has attained in illustrating the
motive of the book, and such good effects as have already
been obtained where the idea has been intelligently carried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>There has been some misunderstanding as to the term
“Wild Garden.” It is applied essentially to the placing of
perfectly hardy exotic plants in places and under conditions
where they will become established and take care of themselves.
It has nothing to do with the old idea of the
“wilderness,” though it may be carried out in connection
with that. It does not necessarily mean the picturesque
garden, for a garden may be highly picturesque, and yet in
every part the result of ceaseless care. What it does mean
is best explained by the winter Aconite flowering under
a grove of naked trees in February; by the Snowflake
growing abundantly in meadows by the Thames side; by the
perennial Lupine dyeing an islet with its purple in a Scotch
river; and by the Apennine Anemone staining an English
wood blue before the blooming of our blue bells. Multiply
these instances a thousandfold, illustrated by many different
types of plants and hardy climbers, from countries as cold
or colder than our own, and one may get a just idea
of the wild garden. Some have erroneously represented
it as allowing a garden to run wild, or sowing annuals
promiscuously; whereas it studiously avoids meddling with
the garden proper at all, except in attempting the improvements
of bare shrubbery borders in the London parks and
elsewhere; but these are waste spaces, not gardens.</p>

<p>I wish it to be kept distinct in the mind from the various
important phases of hardy plant growth in groups, beds, and
borders, in which good culture and good taste may produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
many happy effects; distinct from the rock garden or the
borders reserved for choice hardy flowers of all kinds; from
the best phase of the sub&ndash;tropical garden&mdash;that of growing
hardy plants of fine form; from the ordinary type of spring
garden; and from the gardens, so to say, of our own beautiful
native flowers in our woods and wilds. How far the wild
garden may be carried out as an aid to, or in connection with,
any of the above in the smaller class of gardens, can be best
decided on the spot in each case. In the larger gardens,
where, on the outer fringes of the lawn, in grove, park, copse,
or by woodland walks or drives, there is often ample room,
fair gardens and wholly new and beautiful aspects of vegetation
may be created by its means.</p>

plant mostly excluded from the Garden.</p>
</div></div>


<p>About a generation ago a taste began to be
manifested for placing a number of tender
plants in the open air in summer, with a
view to the production of showy masses
of decided colour. The subjects selected
were mostly from sub&ndash;tropical climates
and of free growth; placed annually in
the open air of our genial early summer,
and in fresh rich earth, every year
they grew rapidly and flowered abundantly
during the summer and early
autumn months, and
until cut down
by the first frosts.
The showy colour
of this system was
very attractive,
and since its introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
there has been a gradual rooting out of all the old
favourites in favour of this “bedding” system. This was
carried to such an extent that it was not uncommon, indeed
it has been the rule, to find the largest gardens in the country
without a single hardy flower, all energy and expense being
devoted to the production of the few exotics required for the
summer decoration. It should be distinctly borne in mind
that the expense for this system is an annual one; that no
matter what amount of money may be spent in this way, or
how many years may be devoted to perfecting it, the first
sharp frost of November announces a yet further expense
and labour, usually more heavy than the preceding.</p>

<p>Its highest results need hardly be described; they are
seen in all our great public gardens; our London and many
other city parks show them in the shape of beds filled with
vast quantities of flowers, covering the ground frequently in
a showy way, or in a repulsively gaudy manner: nearly every
private garden is taken possession of by the same things. I
will not here enter into the question of the merits of this
system; it is enough to state that even on its votaries it is
beginning to pall. Some are looking back with regret to the
old mixed&ndash;border gardens; others are endeavouring to soften
the harshness of the bedding system by the introduction of
fine&ndash;leaved plants, but all are agreed that a great mistake has
been made in destroying all our old flowers, from Lilies to
Hepaticas, though very few persons indeed have any idea of
the numbers of beautiful subjects in this way which we may
gather from every northern and temperate clime to adorn our
gardens under a more artistic system.</p>

<p>My object in the <i>Wild Garden</i> is now to show how we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
may have more of the varied beauty of hardy flowers than
the most ardent admirer of the old style of garden ever dreams
of, by naturalising innumerable beautiful natives of many
regions of the earth in our woods and copses, rougher parts
of pleasure grounds, and in unoccupied places in almost every
kind of garden.</p>

<p>I allude not to the wood and brake flora of any one
country, but to that which finds its home in the vast fields of
the whole northern world, and that of the hill&ndash;ground that
falls in furrowed folds from beneath the hoary heads of all
the great mountain chains of the world, whether they rise
from hot Indian plains or green European pastures. The
Palm and sacred Fig, as well as the Wheat and the Vine, are
separated from the stemless plants that cushion under the
snow for half the year, by a zone of hardier and not less
beautiful life, varied as the breezes that whisper on the
mountain sides, and as the rills that seam them. They are
the Lilies, and Bluebells, and Foxgloves, and Irises, and
Windflowers, and Columbines, and Rock&ndash;roses, and Violets,
and Cranesbills, and countless Pea&ndash;flowers, and mountain
Avens, and Brambles, and Cinquefoils, and Evening Primroses,
and Clematis, and Honeysuckles, and Michaelmas
Daisies, and Wood&ndash;hyacinths, and Daffodils, and Bindweeds,
and Forget&ndash;me&ndash;nots, and blue&ndash;eyed Omphalodes, and Primroses,
and Day Lilies, and Asphodels, and St. Bruno’s Lilies,
and the almost innumerable plants which form the flora of
the northern and temperate portions of vast continents.</p>

<p>It is beyond the power of pen or pencil to picture the
beauty of these plants. Innumerable and infinitely varied
scenes occur in the wilder parts of all northern and temperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
regions, at many different elevations. The loveliness and
ceaselessly varying charms of such scenes are indeed difficult
to describe or imagine; the essential thing to bear in mind is
that the plants that go to form them <i>are hardy, and will thrive
in our climate as well as native plants</i>.</p>

<p>Such beauty may be realised in every wood and copse
and shrubbery that screens our “trim gardens.” Naturally
our woods and wilds have no little loveliness in spring; we
have here and there the Lily&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;valley and the Snowdrop,
and everywhere the Primrose and Cowslip; the Bluebell and
the Foxglove sometimes take nearly complete possession of
whole woods; but, with all our treasures in this way, we have
no attractions in or near our gardens compared to what it is
within our power to create. There are many countries with
winters as cold as, or colder than, our own, possessing a rich
flora; and by taking the best hardy exotics and establishing
them in wild or half&ndash;wild spots, we may produce beautiful
pictures in such places. To most people a pretty
plant in a free state is more attractive than any garden
denizen. It is taking care of itself; and, moreover, it is
usually surrounded by some degree of graceful wild spray&mdash;the
green above, and the moss and brambles and grass around.</p>

<p>By the means presently to be explained, numbers of plants
of the highest order of beauty and fragrance, and clothed with
pleasant associations, may be seen perfectly at home in the
spaces now devoted to rank grass and weeds, and by wood
walks in our shrubberies and ornamental plantations.</p>

<p>Among my reasons for advocating this system are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First</i>, because hundreds of the finest hardy flowers will
thrive much better in rough and wild places than ever they
did in the old&ndash;fashioned border. Even comparatively small
ones, like the ivy&ndash;leaved Cyclamen, a beautiful plant that we
rarely find in perfection in gardens, I have seen perfectly
naturalised and spread all over the mossy surface of a thin
wood.<span class="vh"><a name="ill5" id="ill5">ill5</a></span></p>

<div class="floatright">

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc" style="max-width: 18em;">A “mixed border” with tile edging, the way in which the
beautiful hardy flowers of the world have been grown in
gardens hitherto, when grown at all. (<i>Sketched in a
large garden</i>, 1878.)</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, because they will look infinitely better than ever
they did in gardens, in consequence
of fine&ndash;leaved plant, fern, and flower,
and climber, grass
and trailing shrub,
relieving each other
in ways innumerable
and delightful. Any
one of a thousand
combinations will
prove as far superior
to any aspect of the
old mixed border, or
the ordinary type of
modern flower&ndash;garden,
as is a lovely
mountain valley to
a piece of the “black country.”</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, because, arranged as I propose, no disagreeable
effects result from decay. The raggedness of the old mixed
border after the first flush of spring and early summer bloom
had passed was intolerable, bundles of decayed stems tied to
sticks, making the place look like the parade&ndash;ground of a
number of crossing&ndash;sweepers. When Lilies are sparsely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
dotted through masses of shrubs, their flowers are admired
more than if they were in isolated showy masses; when they
pass out of bloom they are unnoticed amidst the vegetation,
and not eyesores, as when in rigid unrelieved tufts in borders,
etc. In a wild or semi&ndash;wild state the beauty of individual
species will proclaim itself when at its height; and when out
of bloom they will be succeeded by other kinds, or lost
among the numerous objects around.<span class="vh"><a name="ill6" id="ill6">ill6</a></span></p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc" style="max-width: 250px;">Blue flowered Composite plant; fine foliage and habit;

(Mulgedium Plumieri.)</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, because it will enable us to grow many plants
that have never yet obtained a place in
our “trim gardens.” I allude to the
multitudes of plants which, not being
so showy as those usually considered
worthy of a place in gardens, are never
seen therein. The flowers of many of
these are of the highest order
of beauty, especially when
seen in numbers. An
isolated tuft of one of
these, seen in a formal
border, may not be considered
worthy of its
place, while in some
wild glade, in a wood, as
a little colony, grouped
naturally, or associated with like subjects, its effect may be
exquisite. Among the subjects usually considered unfit for
garden cultivation may be included a goodly number that,
grown in gardens, are no addition to them; subjects like the
American Asters, Golden Rods, and like plants, which merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
overrun the choicer and more beautiful border&ndash;flowers when
planted amongst them. These coarse subjects would be quite
at home in copses and woody places, where their blossoms
might be seen or gathered in due season, and their vigorous
vegetation form a covert welcome to the game&ndash;preserver. To
these two groups might be added subjects like the winter
Heliotrope, the handsome British Willow herb, and many
other plants which, while attractive in the garden, are apt to
spread about so rapidly as to become a nuisance there.
Clearly these should only be planted in wild and semi&ndash;wild
places.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, because we may in this way settle also the
question of spring flowers, and the spring garden, as well as
that of hardy flowers generally. In the way I suggest, many
parts of every country garden, and many suburban ones, may
be made alive with spring flowers, without interfering at
least with the geometrical beds that have been the worthless
stock&ndash;in&ndash;trade of the so&ndash;called landscape&ndash;gardener for
centuries. The blue stars of the Apennine Anemone will be
seen to greater advantage “wild,” in shady or half&ndash;shady bare
places, under trees, than in any conceivable formal arrangement,
and it is but one of hundreds of sweet spring flowers
that will succeed perfectly in the way I propose.</p>

<p><i>Sixthly</i>, because there can be few more agreeable phases of
communion with nature than naturalising the natives of
countries in which we are infinitely more interested than in
those of which greenhouse or stove plants are native. From
the Roman ruin&mdash;home of many flowers, the prairies of the
New World, the woods and meadows of all the great mountains
of Europe; from Greece and Italy and Spain, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
sunny hills of Asia Minor; from the alpine regions of the
great continents&mdash;in a word, from almost every interesting
region the traveller may bring seeds or plants, and establish
near his home the pleasantest souvenirs of the various scenes
he has visited.</p>

<p>Moreover, the great merit of permanence belongs to this
delightful phase of gardening. Select a wild rough slope,
and embellish it with the handsomest and hardiest climbing
plants,&mdash;say the noble mountain Clematis from Nepal, the
sweet C. Flammula from Southern Europe, “Virginian
creepers” in variety, the Nootka Bramble (Rubus nutkanus
and R. odoratus), various species of hardy vines, Jasmines,
Honeysuckles&mdash;British and European, and wild Roses.
Arranged with some judgment at first, such a colony might
be left to take care of itself; time would but add to its
attractions, and the happy owner might go away for years,
and find it beautiful on his return.</p>

</div></div>


<p class="pn">I will now
endeavour to
illustrate my
meaning by
showing what
may be done
with one type of northern vegetation&mdash;
that of the Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not order, one far from being as rich
as others in subjects suited for the wild garden. Through
considering its capabilities in this way, the reader may be
able to form some idea of what we may do by selecting from
the numerous plants that grow in the meadows and mountain&ndash;woods
of Europe, Asia, and America.</p>

<p>The Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not or Borage family is a well&ndash;marked
and well&ndash;known one, containing a great number of coarse
weeds, but which, if it possessed only the common Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not,
would have some claims on us. Many persons are not
acquainted with more than the Forget&ndash;me&ndash;nots; but what
lovely exotic plants there are in this order that would afford
delight if met with creeping about along our wood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
shrubbery walks! Nature, say some, is sparing of her deep
true blues; but there are obscure plants in this order that
possess the truest, deepest, and most delicate of blues, and
which will thrive as well in the wild garden as common weeds.
The creeping Omphalodes verna even surpasses the Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not
in the depth and beauty of its blue and its other
good qualities, and runs about quite freely in any shady or
half&ndash;shady shrubbery or open wood, or even in turf in moist
soil not very frequently mown. Its proper home is the wood
or semi&ndash;wild spot, where it takes care of itself. Put it in a
garden, and probably, unless the soil and region be moist, it
soon perishes. Besides, in the border, it would be a not very
agreeable object when once the sweet spring bloom had passed;
whereas, in the positions spoken of, in consequence of the
predominance of trees, shrubs, and tall herbs, the low plants
are not noticed when out of flower, but crawl about unobserved
till returning spring reminds those fortunate enough
to see them how superior is the inexpensive and natural kind
of gardening here advocated.</p>

<p>Another plant of the order is so suitable and useful for this
purpose, that if a root or two of it be planted in any shrubbery,
it will soon run about, exterminate the weeds, and prove
quite a lesson in wild gardening. I allude to the Caucasian
Comfrey (Symphytum caucasicum), which grows about twenty
inches high, and bears quantities of the loveliest blue pendulous
flowers. It, like many others, does much better in
a wood, grove, or any kind of shrubbery, than in any other
position, filling in the naked spaces between the trees and
shrubs, and has a quick&ndash;growing and spreading tendency, but
never becomes weedy or objectionable. As if to contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
with it, there is the deep crimson Bohemian Comfrey (S.
bohemicum), which is sometimes startling from the depth of
its vivid colouring; and the white Comfrey (S. orientale), quite
a vigorous&ndash;growing kind, blooming early in April and May,
with the blue Caucasian C.</p>

<p>These Comfreys, indeed, are admirable plants for rough
places&mdash;the tall and vigorous ones thriving in a ditch or any
similar place, and flowering much better and longer than
they ever did in the garden proper, in prim borders. There
are about twenty species, mostly from Southern and Central
Europe, Asia, and Siberia.</p>

<p>I purposely omit the British Forget&ndash;me&ndash;nots, wishing now
chiefly to show what we may do with exotics quite as hardy
as our own wildlings; and we have another Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not,
not British, which surpasses them all&mdash;the early Myosotis
dissitiflora. This is like a patch of the bluest sky settled
down among the moist stones of a rockwork or any similar
spot, before our own Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not has opened its blue eyes,
and is admirable for blades or banks in wood or shrubbery,
especially in moist districts.</p>

<p>For rocky bare places and sunny sandy banks we have
the spreading Gromwell (Lithospermum prostratum), which,
when in flower, looks just as if some exquisite alpine Gentian
had assumed the form of a low bush, to enable it to hold its
own among creeping things and stouter herbs than accompany
it on the Alps. The Gromwells are a large and important
genus but little known in gardens, some of them, like our
native kind, being handsome plants.</p>

<p>Among the fairest plants we have are the Lungworts,
Pulmonaria, too seldom seen, and partly destroyed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
exposure on bare dug and often dry border. The old
Pulmonaria (Mertensia virginica) is one of the loveliest spring
flowers ever introduced. It is very rare in gardens, but if
placed in a moist place near a stream, or in a peat bottom, it
will live; whereas it frequently dies in a garden. The newer
and more easily grown Mertensia sibirica is a lovely plant,
taller and flowering longer. These two plants alone would
repay any one for a trial of the wild garden, and will illustrate
the fact that for the sake of culture alone (apart from
art, beauty, or arrangement) the wild&ndash;garden idea is worth
carrying out.</p>

<p>Among the many plants suitable for the wild garden none
look more at home than Borage, a few seeds of which scattered
over fresh dry ground soon germinate, and form fine patches
that will flower during the summer. Although only an
annual, once it is introduced there is no fear of losing it, as it
comes up somewhere near the same spot each succeeding
year, and when in bloom the peculiar Solanum&ndash;like shape
of the blossoms, and their rich blue colour, make it beautiful.</p>

<p>The Cretan Borage is a curious old perennial, seldom seen
in gardens; and deservedly so, for its growth is robust and
its habit coarse. It is, however, a capital plant for the wild
garden, or for rough places&mdash;in copse, or shrubbery, or lane,
where the ample room which it requires would not be begrudged,
and where it may take care of itself from year to
year, showing among the boldest and the hardiest of the
early spring flowers.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">The Cretan Borage (Borago Cretica).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, though I say little of the Alkanet (Anchusa) tribe,
several of which could be found worth a place with our own
handsome Evergreen Alkanet, and do not mention other important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
genera, it will be seen that a whole garden of beauty
may be reaped from this tribe alone. Any one who doubts
the advantages of carrying out the idea of the wild garden
could settle the matter to his satisfaction in a couple of years
with these plants alone, in a shrubbery, ditch, lane, copse, or
wood, always providing that he takes care to adapt each kind
to the position and the soil. For instance, the Giant Comfrey
will grow six feet high in rich or moist soil in a partially
shaded ditch, and therefore, once fairly started, might be
trusted to take care of itself in any position. The Caucasian
Comfrey, on the other hand, grows from eighteen inches to
two feet high, and is at home in the spaces in a copse or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
shrubbery. The creeping Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not (Ompalodes verna)
is a little plant that creeps about in grass or among vegetation,
not over a span high, or forms a carpet of its own&mdash;these
points must be considered, and then the rest is gardening of
the happiest kind only. These Borageworts, richer in blue
flowers than even the gentians, are usually poor rusty things
in exposed sunny borders, and also much in the way when
out of flower, whereas in shady lanes, copses, open parts of
not too dry or impoverished shrubberies, in hedgerow&ndash;banks,
or ditches, we only notice them in their beautiful bloom.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">EXAMPLE FROM HARDY BULBS AND TUBERS IN GRASS.</p>

<p class="pn">We will now turn from the Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not order to a very
different type of vegetation&mdash;hardy bulbs and other plants
dying down after flowering early in the year, like the Winter
Aconite and the Blood&ndash;root (Sanguinaria). How many of us
really enjoy the beauty which a judicious use of a profusion
of hardy Spring&ndash;flowering Bulbs affords? How many get
beyond the miserable conventionalities of the flower&ndash;garden,
with its edgings and patchings, and taking up, and drying,
and mere playing with our beautiful Spring Bulbs? How
many enjoy the exquisite beauty afforded by flowers of this
class, established naturally, without troubling us for attention
at any time? The subject of decorating with Spring&ndash;flowering
Bulbs is merely in its infancy; at present we merely place a
few of the showiest of them in geometrical lines. The little
we do leads to such a very poor result, that numbers of people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
alive to the real charms of a garden too, scarcely notice Spring
Bulbs at all, regarding them as things which require endless
trouble, as interfering with the “bedding&ndash;out;” and in fact, as
not worth the pains they occasion. This is likely to be the
case so long as the most effective and satisfactory of all
modes of arranging them is unused; that way is the placing
of them in wild and semi&ndash;wild parts of country seats, and in
the rougher parts of a garden, no matter where it may be
situated or how it may be arranged. This way will yield
more real interest and beauty than any other.</p>

<p>Look, for instance, at the wide and bare belts of grass
that wind in and around the shrubberies in nearly every
country place; frequently, they never display a particle of
plant&ndash;beauty, and are merely places to be roughly mown now
and then. But if planted here and there with the Snowdrop,
the blue Anemone, the Crocus, Scillas, and Winter Aconite,
they would in spring surpass in attractiveness the gayest of
spring gardens. Cushioned among the grass, these would
have a more congenial medium in which to unfold than is
offered by the beaten sticky earth of a border; in the grass of
spring, their natural bed, they would look far better than ever
they do when arranged on the bare earth of a garden. Once
carefully planted, they&mdash;while an annual source of the
greatest interest&mdash;occasion no trouble whatever.<span class="vh"><a name="ill16" id="ill16">ill16</a></span></p>

<div class="floatright">

</div></div>

<p>Their leaves die down so early in spring that they would
scarcely interfere with the mowing of the grass, if that were
desired, but I should not attempt to mow the grass in such
places till the season of vernal beauty had quite passed by.
Surely it is enough to have a portion of lawn as smooth as a
carpet at all times, without sending the mower to shave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
“long and pleasant grass” of the other parts of the grounds.
It would indeed be worth while to leave many parts of the
grass unmown for the sake of growing many beautiful plants
in it. If in some spot where a wide fringe of grass spreads
out in the bay of a shrubbery or plantation, and upon this
carpet of rising and unshaven verdure there be dotted, in
addition to the few pretty natural
flowers that happened to take possession
of it, the blue Apennine
Anemone, the Snowdrop, the Snowflake,
Crocuses in variety, Scillas,
Grape&ndash;Hyacinths, earlier and smaller
Narcissi, the Wood Anemone, and
any other pretty Spring flowers that
were suitable to the soil and position,
we should have a glimpse of the
vernal beauty of temperate and
northern climes, every flower relieved
by grass blades and green
leaves, the whole devoid of any
trace of man, or his exceeding weakness
for tracing wall&ndash;paper patterns,
where everything should be
varied, indefinite, and changeful. In such a garden it
would be evident that the artist had caught the true meaning
of nature in her disposition of vegetation, without
sacrificing one jot of anything of value in the garden,
but, on the contrary, adding the highest beauty to spots
devoid of the slightest interest. In connection with this
matter I may as well say here that <i>mowing the grass once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a fortnight in pleasure grounds, as now practised, is a great
and costly mistake</i>. We want shaven carpets of grass here
and there, but what cruel nonsense both to men and grass it
is to shave as many foolish men shave their faces! There
are indeed places where they boast of mowing forty acres!
Who would not rather see the waving grass with countless
flowers than a close shaven surface without a blossom?
Imagine the labour wasted in this ridiculous labour of cutting
the heads off flowers and grass. Let the grass grow till fit to
cut for hay, and we may enjoy in it a world of lovely flowers
that will blossom and perfect their growth before the grass
has to be mown; more than one person who has carried out
the ideas expressed in this book has waving lawns of feathery
grass where he used to shave the grass every ten days; a
prairie of flowers where a daisy was not allowed to peep; and
some addition to his hay crop as he allows the grass to
grow till it is fit for that purpose.</p>

<p>It is not only to places in which shrubberies, and plantations,
and belts of grass in the rougher parts of the pleasure&ndash;ground,
and shady moss&ndash;bordered wood&ndash;walks occur that these
remarks apply. The suburban garden, with its single fringe
of planting, may show like beauty, to some extent. It may
have the Solomon’s Seal arching forth from a shady recess,
behind tufts of the sweet&ndash;scented Narcissus, while in every
case there may be wild fringes of strong and hardy flowers in
the spring sun, and they cannot be cut off by harsh winds as
when exposed in the open garden. What has already been
stated is, I hope, sufficient to show to everybody the kind of
place that may be used for their culture. Wild and semi&ndash;wild
places, rough banks in or near the pleasure&ndash;ground or flower&ndash;garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
such spots as perhaps at present contain nothing but
weeds, or any naturally rough or unused spot about a garden&mdash;such
are the places for them. Even where all the lawn
must be mown the Snowdrop may be enjoyed in early spring,
for its leaves die down, or at all events ripen sufficiently before
there is any occasion to mow the grass.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill19" id="ill19">ill19</a></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">The Turk’s Cap Lily, naturalised in the grass by wood&ndash;walk.</p>
</div></div>

<p>But the prettiest results are only attainable where the
grass need not be mown till nearly the time the meadows are
mown. Then we may have gardens of Narcissi, such as men
never dared to dream about a dozen years ago; such as no
one ever thought possible in a garden. In grass not mown
at all we may even enjoy many of the Lilies, and all the
lovelier and more stately bulbous flowers of the meadows and
mountain lawns of Europe, Asia, and America.</p>

<p>On a stretch of good grass which need not be mown, and
on fairly good soil in any part of our country, beauty may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
enjoyed such as has hitherto only gladdened the heart of the
rare wanderer on the high mountain lawns and copses, in
May when the earth children laugh in multitudes on their
mother’s breast.</p>

<p>All planting in the grass should be in natural groups or
prettily fringed colonies, growing to and fro as they like after
planting. Lessons in this grouping are to be had in woods,
copses, heaths, and meadows, by those who look about them
as they go. At first many will find it difficult to get out of
formal masses, but that may be got over by studying natural
groupings of wild flowers. Once established, the plants soon
begin to group themselves in a way that leaves nothing to
desire.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">EXAMPLE FROM THE GLOBE FLOWER ORDER.</p>

<p class="pn">Let us next see what may be done with the Buttercup
order of plants. It embraces many things widely diverse
in aspect from these burnished ornaments of northern
meadows and mountains. The first thing I should take
from it to embellish the wild wood is the sweet&ndash;scented
Virgin’s Bower (Clematis flammula), a native of the south
of Europe, but as hardy and free in all parts of Britain
as the common Hawthorn. And as the Hawthorn sweetens
the breath of early summer, so will this add fragrance
to the autumnal months. It is never to be seen half so
beautiful as when crawling over some tree or decayed stump;
and if its profuse masses of white bloom do not attract, its
fragrance is sure to do so. An open glade in a wood, or open
spaces on banks near a wood or shrubbery, would be charming
for it, while in the garden or pleasure&ndash;ground it may be used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
as a creeper over old stumps, trellising, or the like. Clematis
campaniflora, with flowers like a campanula, and of a
pale purplish hue, and the beautiful white Clematis montana
grandiflora, a native of Nepaul, are almost equally beautiful,
and many others of the family are worthy of a place, rambling
over old trees, bushes, hedgerows, or tangling
over banks. These single wild species
of Clematis are more graceful than the
large Hybrids now common; they are
very hardy and free. In mild and seashore
districts a beautiful kind, common
in Algeria, and in the islands on and the
shores of the Mediterranean (Clematis
cirrhosa), will be found most valuable&mdash;being
nearly evergreen, and flowering very
early in spring&mdash;even in winter in the
South of England.<span class="vh"><a name="ill22" id="ill22">ill22</a></span></p>

<p>Next in this order we come to the
Wind Flowers, or Anemones, and here
we must pause to select, for more beautiful
flowers do not adorn this world of
flowers. Have we a bit of rich grass not
mown? If so, the beautiful downy white and yellow
Anemones of the Alps (A. alpina and A. sulphurea) may be
grown there. Any sunny bushy bank or southern slope
which we wish to embellish with vernal beauty? Then
select Anemone blanda, a small but lovely blue kind; place
it in open bare spots to begin with, as it is very dwarf, and
it will at Christmas, and from that time onward through
the spring, open its large flowers of the deepest sky blue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
The common garden Anemone (A. Coronaria) will not be
fastidious, but had better be placed in open bare sandy places;
and the splendid Anemone fulgens will prove most attractive,
as it glows with fiery scarlet. Of other Anemones, hardy,
free, and beautiful enough to be made wild in our shrubberies,
pleasure&ndash;grounds, and wilds, the Japan Anemone (A. japonica)
and its white varieties, A. trifolia and A. sylvestris, are the
best of the exotic species. The Japan Anemones grow so
strongly that they will take care of themselves even among
stiff brushwood, brambles, etc.; and they are beautifully
fitted for scattering along the low, half&ndash;wild margins of shrubberies
and groups. The interesting little A. trifolia is not
unlike our own wood Anemone, and will grow in similar
places.<span class="vh"><a name="ill23" id="ill23">ill23</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Few plants are more lovely in the wild garden than the
White Japan Anemone. The idea of the wild garden first
arose in the writer’s mind as a home for a numerous class
of coarse&ndash;growing plants, to which people begrudge room
in their borders, such as the Golden Rods, Michaelmas Daisies,
Compass plants, and a host of others, which are beautiful for
a season only, or perhaps too rampant for what are called
choice borders and beds. This Anemone is one of the most
beautiful of garden flowers, and one which is as well
suited for the wild garden as the kinds alluded to. It
grows well in any good soil in copse or shrubbery, and
increases rapidly. Partial shade seems to suit it; and in any
case the effect of the large white flowers is, if anything, more
beautiful in half&ndash;shady places. The flowers, too, are more
lasting here than where they are fully exposed.</p>

<p>As for the Apennine Anemone (the white as well as the
blue variety), it is one of the loveliest spring flowers of any
clime, and should be in every garden, in the borders, and
scattered thinly here and there in woods and shrubberies, so
that it may become “naturalised.” It is scarcely a British
flower, being a native of the south of Europe; but having
strayed into our wilds and plantations occasionally, it is
now included in most books on British plants. The yellow
A. ranunculoides, a doubtful native, found in one or two spots,
but not really British, is well worth growing, thriving well
on the chalk, and being very beautiful.</p>

<p>The large Hepatica angulosa will grow almost as
freely as Celandine among shrubs and in half&ndash;shady spots,
and we all know how readily the old kinds grow on all
garden soils of ordinary quality. There are about ten or
twelve varieties of the common Hepatica (Anemone Hepatica)
grown in British nurseries and gardens, and all the colours
of the species should be represented in every collection of
spring flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Anemones in the Riviera. Thrive equally well in any open soil here, only flowering later.</p>
</div></div>

<p>There are many of the Ranunculi, not natives of Britain,
which would grow as freely as our native kinds. Many will
doubtless remember with pleasure the pretty button&ndash;like
white flowers of the Fair Maids of France (Ranunculus
aconitifolius fl. pl.), a frequent ornament of the old mixed
border. This, and the wild form from which it comes&mdash;a
frequent plant in alpine meadows&mdash;may also be enjoyed in
our wild garden. Quite distinct from all these, and of chastest
beauty when well grown, is R. amplexicaulis, with flowers of
pure white, and simple leaves of a dark glaucous green and
flowing graceful outline; a hardy and charming plant on
almost any soil. This is one of the elegant exotic forms of a
family well represented in the golden type in our meadows,
and therefore it is welcome as giving us a strange form.
Such a plant deserves that pains be taken to establish it in
good soil, in spots where a rank vegetation may not weaken
or destroy it.</p>

<p>Of the Globe Flowers (Trollius), there are various kinds
apart from our own, all rich in colour, fragrant, and hardy
in a remarkable degree. These are among the noblest wild&ndash;garden
plants&mdash;quite hardy, free of growth in the heaviest of
soil and wettest of climates, affording a lovely type of early
summer flower&ndash;life, and one distinct from any usually seen
in our fields or gardens; for these handsome Globe flowers
are among the many flowers that for years have found no
place in the garden proper. They are lovely in groups or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
colonies, in cold grassy places, where many other plants
would perish.<span class="vh"><a name="ill26" id="ill26">ill26</a></span></p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc">The Green Hellebore in the Wild Garden.</p>
</div></div>


<p>The Winter Aconite (Eranthis hyemalis) should be
naturalised in every country seat in Britain&mdash;it is as easy to
do so as to introduce the thistle. It may be placed quite
under the branches of deciduous trees, will come up and
flower when the trees are naked, will have its foliage developed
before the leaves come on
the trees, and be afterwards
hidden from sight. Thus
masses of this earliest flower
may be grown without
the slightest
sacrifice of space,
and only be noticed
when bearing a
bloom on every little
stem. That fine old little
plant, the Christmas
Rose (Helleborus
niger), likes partial
shade better than full exposure, and should be used abundantly,
giving it rather snug and warm positions, so that its
flowers may be encouraged to open well and fully. Any
other kinds might also be used. Recently many kinds of
Helleborus have been added to our gardens, not all of them
so conspicuous at first sight as the Christmas Rose, yet they
are of remarkable beauty of foliage and habit as well as of
blossom, and they flower in the spring. These, too, show the
advantage of the wild garden as regards cultivation. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
will <i>thrive much better in any bushy places, or copses, or in
mutually sheltering groups on warm banks and slopes, even in
hedge banks, old quarries, or rough mounds, than in the ordinary
garden border</i>. Of the difference in the effect in the two
cases it is needless to speak.</p>

<p>Some of the Monkshoods are very handsome, but all of
them virulent poisons; and, bearing in mind what fatal
accidents have arisen from their use, they are better not
used at all in the garden proper. Amongst tall and
vigorous herbaceous plants few are more suitable for wild
and semi&ndash;wild places. They are hardy and robust enough
to grow anywhere in shady or half&ndash;shady spots; and their
tall spikes, loaded with blue flowers, are very beautiful.
An illustration in the chapter on the plants suited for the
wild garden shows the common Aconite in a Somersetshire
valley in company with the Butterbur and the Hemlock.
In such a place its beauty is very striking. The larger rich
blue kinds, and the blue and white one, are very showy
grown in deep soils, in which they attain a great height.
When out of flower, like many other stately Perennials, they
were often stiff and ugly in the old borders and beds. In the
wild garden their stately beauty will be more remarkable
than ever under the green leaves in copses and by streams.
And when flower&ndash;time is gone, their stems, no longer tied into
bundles or cut in by the knife, will group finely with other
vigorous herbaceous vegetation.</p>

<p>The Delphiniums, or tall Perennial Larkspurs, are amongst
the most beautiful of all flowers. They embrace almost every
shade of blue, from the rich dark tone of D. grandiflora to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
charming cærulean tints of such as D. Belladonna; and being
usually of a tall and strong type, will make way among long
grasses and vigorous weeds, unlike many things for which we
have to recommend an open space, or a wood with nothing
but a carpet of moss under the trees.<span class="vh"><a name="ill28" id="ill28">28</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>One of the prettiest effects which
I have ever seen was a colony of tall
Larkspurs. Portions of old roots of
several species and varieties had been
chopped off when a
bed of these plants
was dug in the autumn.
For convenience sake
the refuse had been
thrown into the neighbouring
shrubbery, far
in among the shrubs
and trees. Here they
grew in half&ndash;open
spaces, which were so
far removed from the
margin that they were not dug and were not seen. When I
saw the Larkspurs in flower they were certainly the loveliest
things that one could see. They were more beautiful than they
are in borders or beds, not growing in such close stiff tufts, but
mingling with and relieved by the trees above and the shrubs
around. Little more need be said to any one who knows and
cares about such plants, and has an opportunity of planting
in such neglected places. This case points out that one might
make wild gardens from the mere parings and thinnings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the beds and borders in autumn in any place where there is
a collection of good hardy plants.</p>

<p>The engraving on the next page represents one of the most
beautiful effects obtained in his wild garden by an acquaintance
of mine who began when he knew very little of plants and
their favoured haunts, and succeeded well in a not very
favourable site. Herbaceous Pæonies were amongst those
that succeeded best. The effect was very beautiful, either
close at hand or seen at a considerable distance off. Herbaceous
Pæonies are amongst the most free, vigorous, and hardy
of perennial plants, and with them alone most novel and
beautiful effects may be carried out in most places where there
is room. Even in comparatively small gardens, a group or
two outside the margin of a shrubbery would be desirable.
The effect of the blooms amongst the long grass of the wild
garden is finer than any they present in borders, and when
out of flower they do not seem to be in the way, as they often
are thought to be when in borders and beds. It is almost
needless to speak here of the great variety of forms now
obtainable amongst these herbaceous Pæonies, many of which
are agreeably scented. The older forms were not remarkable
in that respect, but rather the contrary. In addition to the
splendour of colour for which Pæonies are long and well
known, there are now many delicately&ndash;coloured and tinted
varieties. The whole race is undeservedly neglected. People
spend plenty of money on greenhouses which will never produce
anything so handsome as a well&ndash;grown group of herbaceous
Pæonies in the open garden; yet when they are grown
they are often begrudged a few feet of good soil, though that
is all they would require for years at a time. My friend’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Pæonies formed a group that could be seen from a distance;
when I saw them they were surrounded by long and waving
grass. I cannot give any idea of the fine effect.</p>

<p>The Clematis&ndash;like Atragene alpina is one of my favourite
flowers&mdash;seldom seen now&ndash;a&ndash;days, or indeed at any time, out
of a botanical garden, and till lately not often seen in one.
It likes to trail over an old stump, or through a thin low bush,
or over a rocky bank, and it is a perfectly hardy plant. Speaking
of such plants as this, one would like to draw a sharp
distinction between them and the various weedy and indistinct
subjects which are now creeping into cultivation owing to
the revival of interest in hardy plants. Many of these have
some botanical interest, but they can be only useless in the
garden. Our chief danger now is getting plants into cultivation
which are neither very distinct nor very beautiful, while
perhaps we neglect many of the really fine kinds. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Atragene is a precious plant for low bush and bank wild
garden.</p>

<p>Among plants which one never sees, and which, indeed,
one never ought to see, in a flower garden, are the Meadow
Rues; and yet there is a quiet beauty and grace about these
plants which entitle them to some consideration; and the
flowers, too, of certain species, particularly the one here
shown in the illustration on page 1, are of singular beauty.
When it is considered that all the species will grow anywhere&mdash;in
any hedgerow or lane or byeway, or among coarse grass,
or in a copse, or under the shrubs, in places usually abandoned
to common weeds, there is no reason why numbers of them
should not be rescued from the oblivion of the botanic
garden.</p>

<p class="pn">What first suggested the idea of the wild
garden, and even the name to me,
was the desire to provide a home
for a great number of exotic plants
that are unfitted for garden culture
in the old sense. Many of these
plants have great beauty when in flower,
and perhaps at other seasons, but they are
frequently so free and vigorous in growth
that they overrun and destroy all their more
delicate neighbours. Many, too, are so coarse
that they are objectionable in choice borders,
and after flowering they leave a blank or a
mass of unsightly stems. These plants are
unsightly in gardens, and the main cause of
the neglect of hardy flowers; yet many are beautiful at certain
stages. A tall Harebell, for example, stiffly tied up in a
garden border, as has been the fashion where plants of this
kind have been grown at all, is at best of times an unsightly
object; but the same plant growing amongst the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
grass in a thin wood is lovely.
The Golden&ndash;rods and Michaelmas
Daisies used to overrun the old
mixed border, and were with it
abolished. But even the poorest of
these seen together in a New England
wood in autumn form a picture. So
also there are numerous exotic plants
of which the individual flowers may
not be so striking, but which, grown
in groups and colonies, and seen at
some little distance off, afford beautiful
aspects of vegetation, and quite
new so far as gardens are concerned.
When I first wrote this book, not
one of these plants was in cultivation
outside botanic gardens. It was
even considered by the best friends
of hardy flowers a mistake to recommend
one of them, for they knew
that it was the predominance of these
weedy vigorous subjects that made
people give up hardy flowers for the
sake of the glare of bedding plants;
therefore, the wild garden in the case
of these particular plants opens up to
us a new world of infinite and strange
beauty. In it every plant vigorous
enough not to require the care of the
cultivator or a choice place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
mixed border will find a home. Of such plants there are
numbers in every northern and mountainous country, which
travellers may gather and afterwards grow in their own
gardens. The taller Achilleas, the stately Aconites,
the seldom&ndash;seen Actæas, the huge and vigorous, but at
certain seasons handsome, Althæas, Angelica with its fine
foliage, the herbaceous kinds of Aralia from the American
woods, also with fine foliage, the Wormwood family
(Artemisia), the stronger kinds of American cotton&ndash;weed
(Asclepias), certain of the vigorous species of Asparagus,
Asters and their allies in great variety, the larger and more
vigorous species of Astragalus, certain of the larger species of
Betonica, pretty, and with delicate flowers, but hardly fit for
the mixed border, various free and vigorous exotic Grasses,
large and showy Bupthalmums, the handsome creeping Bindweeds,
too free in a garden, the most vigorous Campanulas,
exotic Thistles (Carduus) and their allies, the more remarkable
kinds of Carex, numerous Centaureas, somewhat too
coarse for the garden; and among other strong and hardy
genera, the following are chiefly suitable for the wild garden:</p>

<p class="pn">Men usually seek sunny positions for
their gardens, so that even
those obliged to be contented
with the north side
of the hill would scarcely
appreciate some of the
above&ndash;named positions.
What, the gloomy and
weedy dyke as a garden!
Yes, there are ditches, dry
and wet, in every district,
that may readily be made
more beautiful than many
a “modern flower&ndash;garden.”
But what would grow in
them? Many of the beautiful wood and shade&ndash;loving plants
of our own and similar latitudes&mdash;things that love not the
open sunny hill&ndash;sides or wide meadows, but take shelter in the
stillness of deep woods or in dark valleys, are happy deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
between riven rocks, and gaily occupy the little dark caves
beneath the great boulders on many a horror&ndash;stricken mountain
gorge, and which garland with inimitable grace the vast
flanks of rock that guard the dark courses of the rivers on
their paths through the hills. And as these dark walls,
ruined by ceaseless pulse of the torrent, are beautiful
exceedingly, how much more may we make all the shady
dykes and narrow lanes that occur everywhere! For while
the nymph&ndash;gardener of the ravine may depend for her novelties
on the stray grains of seeds brought in the moss by the
robin when building her nest, or on the mercy of the hurrying
wave, we may place side by side the snowy white wood lily
(Trillium grandiflorum), whose home is in the shades of the
American woods, with the twin flower of Scotland and northern
Europe, and find both thrive on the same spot in happy companionship.
And so in innumerable instances. And not only
may we be assured of numbers of the most beautiful plants of
other countries thriving in deep ditches and in like positions,
but also that not a few of them, like the white wood lily, will
thrive much better in them than in any position in garden
borders. This plant, when in perfection, has a flower as fair
as any white lily, while it is seldom a foot high; but, in consequence
of being a shade&ndash;loving and wood plant, it usually
perishes in the ordinary garden bed or border, while in a
shady dyke or any like position it will be found to thrive as
well as in its native woods; and if in deep, free, sandy, or
vegetable soil, to grow so as not to be surpassed in loveliness
by anything seen in our stoves or greenhouses.</p>

<p>Our wild flowers take possession of the stiff, formal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
shorn hedges that seam the land, often draping them with
such inimitable grace that half the conservatories in the
country, with their collections of small red pots and small
mean plants are stiff and poor compared with a few yards’
length of their blossomy verdure. The Wild Roses, Purple
Vetch, Honeysuckle, and the Virgin’s Bower, clamber above
smaller, but not less pretty, wildlings, and throw a veil of
graceful life over the mutilated shrubs, reminding us of the
plant&ndash;life in the nest&ndash;like thickets of dwarf shrubs that one
often meets on the high Alpine meadows. In these islets of
bushes in a sea of grass one may gather flowers after they
have been all browsed down on the turf. Next to the most
interesting aspects of Alpine vegetation, there is perhaps
nothing in the world of plant&ndash;life more lovely than the delicate
tracery of low&ndash;climbing things wedded to the bushes in all
northern and temperate regions of the earth. Perishing like the
grass, they are happy and safe in the earth’s bosom in winter;
in spring they come up as the buds swell, and soon after,
finding the bushes once more enjoyable, rush over them as
joyously as children from school over a meadow of cowslips.
Over bush, over brake, on mountain or lowland copse, holding
on with delicate but unyielding grasp, they engrave themselves
on the mind as the central type of grace. In addition to
climbing Pea&ndash;flowers, Convolvuluses, etc., of which the stems
perish in winter, we have the great tribes of wild vines, noble
in foliage and often in fruit, the numerous Honeysuckles,
from coral red to pale yellow, all beautiful; and the Clematidæ,
rich, varied, and lovely beyond description, from those
of which each petal reminds one of the wing of some huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
tropical butterfly, to those with small flowers borne in showers
like drops from a fountain jet, and often sweet as Hawthorn
blossoms.<span class="vh"><a name="ill39" id="ill39">ill39</a></span></p>

<p>This climbing vegetation may
be trained and tortured into forms
in gardens, but never
will its beauty be seen
until we entrust
it to the garlanding
of shrub, and
copse, or hedgerow,
fringes of
dwarf plantation,
or groups of
shrubs and trees.
All to be done is to
put in a few tufts of
any desired kind, and leave them
alone, adapting the kind to the
position. The large, flesh&ndash;coloured
Bindweed, for example, would be best in
rough places, out of the pale of the pleasure&ndash;ground
or garden, so that its roots would
not spread where they could do harm,
while a delicate Clematis might be placed
beneath the choicest specimen Conifer, and
allowed to paint its rich green with fair
flowers. In nature we frequently see a Honeysuckle clambering
up through an old Hawthorn tree, and then struggling
with it as to which should produce the greatest profusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of blossoms&mdash;but in gardens not yet. Some may say that
this cannot be done in gardens; but it can be done infinitely
better in gardens than it has ever been done in nature; because,
for gardens we can select plants from many countries. We
can effect contrasts, in which nature is poor in any one place
in consequence of the comparatively few plants that naturally
inhabit one spot of ground. People seldom remember that “the
art itself is nature;” and foolish old laws laid down by landscape&ndash;gardeners
are yet fertile in perpetuating the
notion that a garden is a “work of art, and therefore
we must not attempt in it to
imitate nature.”<span class="vh"><a name="ill40" id="ill40">ill40</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, where there are
large and bare slopes, an excellent
effect may be obtained by planting
the stouter climbers, such as the

Honeysuckles, in groups or masses

only suitable for this kind of gardening.</p>

<p>Among the families of plants that are suitable for the
various positions enumerated at the head of this chapter
may be named&mdash;Acanthus, any variety, Viola, both the
sweet varieties and some of the large scentless kinds, the

Starworts (Aster), for hedgerows, and among the taller plants
the Italian Cuckoo Pint (Arum), and also the Dragons, for
warm sandy soils, the Monkshoods which people fear in gardens
and which do admirably in many positions; the different

<p class="pn">The numerous hardy climbers which we possess
are very rarely seen to advantage, owing
to their being stiffly trained against walls.
Indeed, the greater number of hardy climbers
have gone out of cultivation mainly for this
reason. One of the happiest of all ways of
using them is that of training them in a free
manner over trees; in this way many beautiful
effects may be secured. Established trees
have usually exhausted the ground near their
base, which may, however, afford nutriment
to a hardy climbing shrub. In some low trees
the graceful companion may garland their heads; in tall ones
the stem only may at first be adorned. But some vigorous
climbers could in time ascend the tallest trees, and there can be
nothing more beautiful than a veil of such a one as Clematis
montana suspended from the branch of a tall tree. A whole
host of lovely plants may be seen to great advantage in this
way, apart from the well&ndash;known and popular climbing plants.
There are, for example, many species of Clematis which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
have never come into cultivation, but which are quite as
beautiful as any climbers. The same may be said of the
Honeysuckles, wild Vines, and various other families of which
the names may be found in catalogues. Much of the northern
tree and shrub world is garlanded with creepers, which may
be grown in similar ways, as, for example, on banks and
in hedgerows. The trees in our pleasure&ndash;grounds, however,
have the first claim on our attention in planting garlands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
There would seldom be need to fear injury to established
trees.</p>

<p>Some time ago I saw a Weeping Willow, on the margin of
a lake, that had its trunk clothed with Virginian Creeper, and
the effect in autumn, when
the sun shone through the
drooping branches of the
Willow&mdash;whose leaves were
just becoming tinged with
gold&mdash;upon the crimson of
the creeper&ndash;covered trunk
was very fine. The Hop is
a very effective plant for
draping a thin specimen
Arbor&ndash;vitæ, or Yew tree, but
the shoots should be thinned
out in spring, and not more
than three or four allowed
to climb up to the tree.
When the leader emerges
from the top of the bush,
and throws its long, graceful
wreaths of Hops over the dark green foliage, the contrast
is most effective. The Wistaria, if planted before its support
has become old, will combine with excellent effect with any
single specimen of not too dense a habit.<span class="vh"><a name="ill45a" id="ill45a">ill45a</a></span></p>

<p>A correspondent, who has added largely to the charms of
a place in Suffolk by means of the wild garden, writes as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“Some time ago I discovered and had removed from
the woods to the pleasure&ndash;grounds a robust round&ndash;headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Holly tree, which had been taken entire possession of by a
wild Honeysuckle, which, originating at the root of the tree,
had scrambled up through the branches to the top, and there,
extending itself in all directions, had formed a large head and
hung in festoons all round&mdash;a highly ornamental object
indeed. The Holly had endured the subjection for many
years, and still
seemed to put forth
sufficient shoots and
leaves annually to
ensure a steady support
to its climbing
companion. The
birds also had discovered
that the
dense and tangled
thicket created by
the Honeysuckle was
a suitable home for
their young, for inside
of it was a regular
settlement of nests
of various kinds;
and, since the tree has been moved it has been taken
complete possession of again by the bird tribe.” The
Honeysuckle in question is an example of what might
be done with such handsome and free growing climbers
and scrambling Roses. What could be more effective, for
instance, than a lofty tree&ndash;like mass of the purple and
white Clematis mixed, or either of these alone, or, better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
still, a gigantic head of Roses? I throw out these hints
for those who choose to act upon them. Draped trees,
such as I have described, may soon be had. I do not know
that a better tree than the Holly could be selected for a
support. Where the trees are not in the place in which they
are wanted, they should be moved about the end of August
to the desired situation, and if some good rich soil&mdash;loam and
decayed manure&mdash;is furnished to the roots at the same time,
it will be in proper condition for climbers in spring. The
latter should be planted pretty closely to the stem of the tree,
and a start should be made with good vigorous plants, whether
of Honeysuckle, Roses, or Clematis. The Roses and other
things will want a little leading off at first till they get hold
of their supporters, but afterwards no pruning or interference
should be attempted.<span class="vh"><a name="ill47" id="ill47">ill47</a></span></p>

of growing woody Climbers away from walls or other
supports.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Hovey, in a letter from Boston, Mass., wrote as
follows, on certain interesting aspects of tree drapery:&mdash;
Some ten or fifteen years ago we had occasion to plant three or
four rows of popular climbers in nursery rows, about 100 feet long;
these consisted of the Virginian creeper, the Moonseed (Menispermum),
Periploca græca, and Celastrus scandens; subsequently, it happened
accidentally that four rows of rather large Tartarian (so&ndash;called) Arbor&ndash;vitæs
were planted on one side, and about the same number of rows
of Smoke trees, Philadelphus, and Cornus florida, on the other. For
three or four years many of these climbers were taken up annually
until rather too old to remove, and year by year the Arbor&ndash;vitæs and
shrubs were thinned out until what were too large to safely transplant
remained. But the land was not wanted then, and the few scattered
trees and climbers grew on while cultivation was partially neglected, a
large specimen being occasionally taken out until the climbers had
fairly taken possession of the trees, and are now too beautiful to
disturb. It forms the most unique specimen of tree drapery I have
ever seen. Some of the Arbor&ndash;vitæs are entirely overrun with the
Moonseed (Menispermum), whose large, slightly&ndash;scalloped leaves overlap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
one another from the ground to the top like slates on a roof.
Over others, the gloomy leaves of the Periploca scramble, and also the
Celastrus, and on still others the deep green leaves of the Ampelopsis
completely festoon the tree; of some trees all four and other climbers
have taken possession; and from among the tops of the Sumach the
feathery tendrils of the Ampelopsis, and, just now, its deep blue berries
hold full sway. And these are not all. The Apios tuberosa is
indigenous, and springs up everywhere as soon as our land is neglected.
This has also overrun several trees, and coils up and wreaths each outstretching
branch with its little bunches of fragrant brownish coloured
flowers. It is the Arbor&ndash;vitæs which give the peculiar beauty of this
description of tree drapery. On the deciduous trees the new growth
lengthens rapidly, and the branches soon get far apart; but with
Arbor&ndash;vitæs, which always present a round compact head, the effect
is entirely different; they are covered so densely that it is impossible,
in some instances, to say what the tree is that supports the climbers.
One Hemlock Spruce (Abies canadensis) has every branch loaded with
the Apios and profuse with blossoms; but this one sees happen with
other trees. The Smoke tree looks interesting just now, while its
flowers are fresh, but soon they will fade, and the dry tops will be a
disadvantage; but the Arbor&ndash;vitæ will remain clothed with the
foliage, flowers, and berries too, of the Celastrus until the autumn
frosts have shorn them of their beauty, and no falling leaves are
scattered around. The Arbor&ndash;vitæ is the tree I would recommend
when it is desirable to produce such effects as I have described. When
such strong&ndash;growing climbers as Begonias and Wistarias take possession
of a shrub they generally injure it; but the very slender stems of
Menispermum and Apios die entirely to the ground after the first sharp
frost, and the slender stems of the others do not appear to arrest the growth
of the Arbor&ndash;vitæs, which are restored when the climbers are down, and,
after full eight months’ rest, are again ready to aid in sustaining their
more dependent companions. The Honeysuckle, the Clematis, and
similar plants might, no doubt, be added to the list, and give more
variety, as well as fragrance and beauty, but I have only detailed the
effects of what has been done, leaving what might be effected for some
future trial.<span class="vh"><a name="ill48" id="ill48">ill48</a></span></p></div>

<p>But the noblest kind of climbers forming drapery for trees
are not so often seen as some of the general favourites mentioned
above. A neglected group are the wild Vines, plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of the highest
beauty, and
which, if allowed
to spring
through the tall
trees, which
they would
quickly do,
would soon
charm by their
bold grace.
Some of them
are fine in colour
of foliage in
autumn. With
these might
be associated,
though not so
fine in form, certain
free&ndash;growing
species
of Ampelopsis,
grown in some
nurseries. The
Wistaria is also
well worth
growing on
trees, in districts
where it
flowers freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
away from walls. In visiting the garden of MM. Van Eden,
at Haarlem, I was surprised to see a Liane, in the shape of the
well&ndash;known Aristolochia or Dutchman’s Pipe, which had
clambered high into a fine old deciduous Cypress. Being
much interested in this long&ndash;established companionship, I
was able to procure, through the kindness of Messrs. Van
Eden, photographs of the tree and its Liane, from which this
illustration was engraved. When I saw it early in spring
the leaves had not appeared on either the tree or its companion,
and the effect of the old rope&ndash;like stems was very
picturesque. The Aristolochia ascends to a height of 35 ft.
6 in. on the tree.</p>

<p>The tree was a superb specimen, and was not in the least
injured by the growth of the climber. What a beautiful
effect a graceful flowering climber would afford in a similar
case! Imagine one of the white&ndash;flowered Clematis (which
may be seen as many as over forty feet in height under suitable
conditions) garlanding such a tree, or any tree, with
wreaths of fragrant blossoms. Strange and lovely aspects of
vegetation may be created in our pleasure&ndash;grounds by the
judicious use of these climbers, varying according to the trees
and their position, and also as to their being evergreen or
summer&ndash;leafing. Even where one might fear to injure a
valuable tree by a vigorous climber, trees may easily be
found of little value, and much may be done even with the
old or dead trees.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE COMMON SHRUBBERY, WOODS AND WOODLAND DRIVES.</p>

<p class="pn">It must not be thought that the wild garden can only be
formed in places where there is some extent of rough pleasure&ndash;ground.
Excellent results may be obtained from the system
in comparatively small gardens, on the fringes of shrubberies
and marginal plantations, open spaces between shrubs, the
surface of beds of Rhododendrons, where we may have plant&ndash;beauty
instead of garden&ndash;graveyards. I call garden&ndash;graveyards
the dug shrubbery borders which one sees in nearly all
gardens, public or private. Every shrubbery and plantation
surface that is so needlessly and relentlessly dug over by the
gardener every winter, may be embellished in the way I
propose, as well as wild places. The custom of digging
shrubbery borders prevails now in every garden, and there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in the whole course of gardening no worse or more profitless
custom. When winter is once come, almost every gardener,
although animated with the best intentions, simply prepares
to make war upon the roots of everything in his shrubbery
border. The generally&ndash;accepted practice is to trim, and often
to mutilate the shrubs, and to dig all over the surface that
must be full of feeding roots. Delicate half&ndash;rooted shrubs
are disturbed; herbaceous plants are destroyed; bulbs are
displaced and injured; the roots as well as the tops of shrubs
are mutilated; and a sparse depopulated aspect is given to
the margins, while the only “improvement” that is effected
by the process is the annual darkening of the surface by the
upturned earth.</p>

<p>Illustrations of these bad practices occur by miles in our
London parks in winter. Walk through any of them at that
season, and observe the borders around masses of shrubs, choice
and otherwise. Instead of finding the earth covered, or nearly
covered, with vegetation close to the margin, and each individual
plant developed into something like a fair specimen
of its kind, we find a spread of recently&ndash;dug ground, and the
plants upon it with an air of having recently suffered from a
whirlwind, or some calamity that necessitated the removal of
mutilated branches. Rough&ndash;pruners precede the diggers, and
bravely trim in the shrubs for them, so that nothing may be in
the way; and then come the diggers, plunging their spades
deeply about plants, shrubs, or trees. The first shower that
occurs after this digging exposes a whole network of torn&ndash;up
roots. There is no relief to the spectacle; the same thing
occurs everywhere&mdash;in botanic gardens as well as in our large
West&ndash;end parks; and year after year is the process repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>While such is the case, it will be impossible to have an
agreeable or interesting margin to a shrubbery or plantation.
What secrets one might have in the central hidden portions of
these now dug and bare shrubberies&mdash;in the half&ndash;shady spots
where little colonies of rare exotic wildlings might have their
first introduction to our wild garden! Of course all the labour
required to produce this miserable result of dug borders is
worse than thrown away, as the shrubberies would do better
if let alone, and by utilising the power thus wasted, we might
highly beautify the positions that are now so ugly.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill53" id="ill53">ill53</a></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Large White Achilleas spread into wide masses under
shade of trees in shrubbery.</p>
</div></div>

<p>If we resolve that no annual manuring or digging is to be
permitted, nobody will grudge a thorough preparation at first.
When a plantation of shrubs is quite young it is well to
keep the ground open by lightly stirring it for a year or two.
Then the planting should be so arranged as to defeat the
digger. To graduate the vegetation from the taller subjects
behind to the very margin of the grass is of much importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and this could be done best by the greater use of dwarf evergreens.
Happily, there is quite enough of these to be had
suitable for every soil. Light, moist, peaty, or sandy soils,
where such things as the sweet&ndash;scented Daphne Cneorum
would spread forth its dwarf cushions, would be somewhat
more desirable than, say, a stiff clay; but for every position
suitable plants might be found. Look, for example, at what
we could do with the dwarf&ndash;green Iberises, Helianthemums,
Aubrietias, Arabises, Alyssums, dwarf shrubs, and little
conifers like the creeping Cedar (Juniperus squamata), and
the Tamarix&ndash;leaved Juniper, in spreading groups and colonies.
All these are green, and would spread out into dense wide
cushions, covering the margin, rising but little above the
grass, and helping to cut off the formal line which usually
divides margin and border. Behind them we might use other
shrubs, deciduous or evergreen, in endless variety; and of
course the margin should be varied also as regards height.</p>

<p>In one spot we might have a wide&ndash;spreading tuft of the
prostrate Savin pushing its graceful evergreen branchlets out
over the grass; in another the dwarf little Cotoneasters might
be allowed to form the front rank, relieved in their turn by
pegged&ndash;down Roses; and so on without end. Herbaceous
plants, that die down in winter and leave the ground bare
afterwards, should not be assigned any important position
near the front. Evergreen Alpine plants and shrubs, as
before remarked, are perfectly suitable here; but the true
herbaceous type, and the larger bulbs, like Lilies, should be
in groups between spreading shrubs. By so placing them,
we should not only secure a far more satisfactory general
effect, but highly improve the aspect of the herbaceous plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
themselves. To carry out such planting properly, a little
more time at first and a great deal more taste than are now
employed would be required; but what a difference in the
result! All that the well&ndash;covered borders would require
would be an occasional weeding or thinning, and, in the case
of the more select spots, a little top&ndash;dressing with fine soil.
Here and there, between and amongst the plants, such things
as Forget&ndash;me&ndash;nots and Violets, Snowdrops and Primroses,
might be scattered about, so as to give the borders interest
even at the dullest seasons; and thus we should be delivered
from digging and dreariness, and see our once ugly borders
alive with flowers. The chief rule should be&mdash;never show
the naked earth: clothe it, and then allow the taller plants
to rise in their own way through the turf or spray. Here is
a little sketch of what is meant. A colony of the white
Arabis carpets the ground in which strong hardy Lilies are
growing; and the Lilies are pushing up their bold unfolding
shoots. The latter are none the worse in winter for this light
carpet of foliage over the border; and then for a long time in
spring it is bedecked with white flowers. Indeed, in fairly
good seasons it blooms in winter too. It would take a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
book to tell all the charms and merits belonging to the use
of a variety of small plants to carpet the ground beneath and
between those of larger growth. It need hardly be said that
this argument against digging applies to two or three beds of
shrubs, and places where the “shrubbery” is little larger than
the dining&ndash;room, as much as to the large country seat, public
park, or botanic garden.</p>

<p>There are great cultural advantages too, in leaving the
whole of the leaves to nourish the ground and protect it from
frost or heat. I append a note from a correspondent inquiring
about what he supposes practical difficulties, and an answer
to them:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">You draw a pretty picture of what a shrubbery border should be
and how it should be kept in winter. There should be no digging,
and the fallen leaves should be left. I fully agree, except as to the
leaves. Theoretically, it seems quite right to allow the leaves to lie
and decay amidst the surrounding plants, but in practice it does not
answer. There are, for instance, in most gardens such things as slugs
and snails. These delight in a leafy covering, and, protected from
frost by the shelter, will prey upon the perennial green leafage and
the starting crowns of the herbaceous plants, and do an immense
amount of mischief. Then there are usually in gardens in winter,
especially in hard weather, blackbirds and thrushes, which in their
efforts to obtain food set all notions of tidiness at defiance. A troop
of fowls would hardly turn a flower border more topsy&ndash;turvy than
would a few of these birds. The first storm that came would whirl
the disturbed leaves all over the place, much to the disgust of the
cultivator, and the hardy plants would find that the theory of a natural
dressing of leaf manure had broken down. I detest the forking of
borders so common in winter. A moderate stirring of the surface
first with a two or three&ndash;tined rake is good, then a dressing of soot or
guano, or both, and over all a thin surfacing of old pot soil, or the
rough screened produce of the rubbish heap, or, in fact, any kind of
refuse soil that may offer. I think that most cultivators will agree
that such a plan would answer better than the natural, but very
inoperative leaf&ndash;dressing.&mdash;A.</p>

<p>How do the swarming herbs of the woods and copses of the
world exist in spite of the slugs? A good protection for them
is hard gravel walks and paths, where they lay their eggs
without danger. Against the door one may do what one
likes, but not one leaf would I ever allow removed from
a clump of shrubs or trees on my lawn or in my pleasure
ground. I would prefer the leaves all over the place to a
dug border, but I would, if need be, meet that difficulty by
scattering a light dressing of soil over them. In what I
should call a properly managed shrubbery or clump, with the
bushes well spaced, and their branches resting on the ground,
with low shrubs between, and evergreen and other herbs,
there are natural impediments to the leaves rushing about in
the way you suppose. This is a subject of the greatest interest
and the utmost practical importance. Our annual digging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
mutilation, scraping away of leaves, and exposing on bare
sloppy borders plants that in Nature shelter each other, and
are shielded from bitter frost and burning heat by layers of
fallen leaves, gradually sinking into excellent light surface
soil for the young roots, are ignorant and brutal practices that
must be given up by all who really look into the needs of our
hardy garden flora.</p>

<p>With reference to this point, I print this letter from an
observer of what goes on in the woods of New England.
Our own woods are full of lessons, and so it is in all countries.
Mr. Falconer’s letter is very suggestive of the revolution in
method which must be carried out in the gardens of the
future:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I go into the woods in the spring time, and find them carpeted
with Dog’s&ndash;tooth Violets, Wood Anemones, blue and purple Hepaticas,
Spring beauty, Trilliums, Blood&ndash;root, Star&ndash;flowers, False Solomon’s
Seal, Gold Thread, trailing Arbutus, wild Ginger, and a host of other
pretty little flowers, all bright and gay, arising from their bed of
decaying herbage and tree leaves, and many of them are in perfection,
too, before a tree has spread a leaf; and thus they glow and revel in
their cosy bed, fed and sheltered by their tree friends. When their petals
drop and their leaves are mature, the trees expand their leafy canopy
and save the little nurslings from the torture of a scorching sun. And
early as the earliest, too, the outskirts of the woods and meadows with
hosts of Violets are painted blue and white, and speckled everywhere
with Bluets, or little Innocents, as the children call them. Woodsias,
tiny Aspleniums, and other Ferns are unfolding their fronds along the
chinks among the stones; the common Polypody is reaching over
blocks and boulders; and even the exposed rocks, with their rough
and Lichen&ndash;bearded faces, are aglow in vernal pride. Every nook and
cranny among them, and little mat of earth upon them are checkered
with the flowery print of the Canada Columbine, the Virginia Saxifrage,
and the glaucous Corydalis. But to the carpet. What can be prettier
or more appropriate than the Partridge&ndash;berry (Mitchella repens), the
Twin&ndash;flower (Linnæa borealis&mdash;does well with us), Creeping Winter
Green (Gaultheria procumbens), Bearberry (Arctostaphylos Uva&ndash;Ursi),
Cowberry (Vaccinium Vitis&ndash;idæa), Dwarf Cornel (Cornus canadensis),
Fringed Polygala (P. paucifolia), the Common Pipsissewa (Chimaphila
umbellata) with its shining deep green leaves, the Spotted Pipsissewa
(C. maculata), the sombre&ndash;hued Pyrola and Galax, and that bright
and easily&ndash;grown Club Moss (Lycopodium lucidulum)? Add to
these such plants as Winter Aconite, Apennine Anemone, Creeping
Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not, and the like, together with a few of the most suitable
kinds of the host of bulbous ornamental plants which we now possess,
and our shrubbery carpets may be replete with garden jewels. It is
now generally conceded that shrubs thrive better in beds whose surface
is undisturbed than where it is annually loosened by digging or pointing.
This, coupled with a yearly top&ndash;dressing of decayed leaf&ndash;soil or
light rich vegetable heap compost, is equally beneficial for the shrubs
and their carpet.</p>

<p>“One day last spring, when strolling through the Medford
wood, I came upon an open meadow with a high bank&mdash;cleared
timber land&mdash;on one side. Adown this bank in a
rough and rocky course, came a little stream of water, bordered
on both sides with streaks and patches of Blood&ndash;root in its
gayest state. The large and showy blossoms, clasped erect
in their own leaf&ndash;vases and sparkling in the sun, while the
sward and other vegetation around were yet dormant, had a
cheerful influence indeed. True, near by in the hollow, the
malodorous Skunk Cabbage was rank in leaf and flower, and
the Indian Poke was rushing out its plaited, broadly oval
leaves, and away in the streamlet a few Marsh Marigolds
glittered on the water. But the Blood&ndash;root is neither an
aquatic nor a bog plant, but most at home in the leaf&ndash;mould
beds and linings of rich woodlands.”</p>

<p>“Hereabout, a little wild flower (Erythronium americanum)
more commonly known as Dog’s&ndash;tooth Violet, is a charming
plant, with variegated handsome leaves, and comely flowers
in earliest spring. In low copses in rich deposits of vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
mould it grows around here in the utmost profusion. In
one place by the side of a wood is a sort of ditch, which is
filled with water in winter but dry in summer, and wherein
is collected a mass of leaf&ndash;soil. Here the Erythronium runs
riot, and forms the densest kind of matted sod, all bespeckled
with yellow blossoms before a bush or tree has spread a leaf.
Then blackberry bushes get a growing and sprawling everywhere,
the trees expand their leafy shade, and Grass and
weeds grow up and cover the surface of the earth. But all
too late for evil, the Adder’s&ndash;tongue’s mission for a year is
ended; it has blossomed, matured, and retired. The next
densest mass I know of is in a low piece of cleared timber
land, where, besides the profusion in the hollow, the carpet
extends, thinner as it ascends, for many yards up the slope of
the hill. As garden plants they are at home anywhere, underneath
bushes, or in any out of&ndash;the&ndash;way corner, merely praying
to be let alone. But what I desire to urge is their naturalisation
in your rich woodlands, where Anemones and Primroses,
Buttercups and Violets, grow up and flower together.”</p>

<p>I cannot better conclude this chapter than by showing one
of the most interesting aspects of vegetation I have ever seen.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was in an ordinary shrubbery, forming a belt round a
botanic garden. In the inner parts, hidden from the walk
probably from want of labour, the digging had not been carried
out for some years. Some roots of the common Myrrh
(Myrrhis odorata), thrown out of the garden in digging, had
rooted by accident and spread into a little colony. The plant
grows freely in any soil. Among the graceful tufts of Myrrh
were tall white Harebells, and the effect of these, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
above the elegant spreading foliage of the Myrrh in the shade
of the trees, was very beautiful. Note particularly that the
front of the shrubbery in which this exquisite scene was
discovered was as stiff and hideous as usual in winter&mdash;raw
earth, full of mutilated roots, and shrubs cut in for the convenience
and according to the taste of the diggers. The beds
in the botanical arrangement near were ugly beyond description.</p>

<p>Longleat is one of the first places in which the idea of
the wild garden was practically carried out and ably by the
forester, Mr. Berry. With such a fine variety of surface and
soil, the place naturally offers numerous positions in which
the plants of other countries as cold or colder than our own
could be naturalised, or so planted that they would increase
and take care of themselves in the woods. A forester’s duties
and opportunities are generally such as make it extremely
difficult for him to carry out such an idea. To know the
plants even that are likely to succeed is, in itself, a species of
knowledge which every planter does not possess; however,
the idea was clearly understood and carried out well, so far
as possible in the face of rabbits, which are the great destroyers
of almost all flowering ground vegetation. To get the necessary
quantities of subjects necessitated a little nursery in
which a sufficient number could be raised of the more vigorous
perennials, bulbs, and climbers. If this new idea in gardening
be carried out on the old dotting principle of the herbaceous
border, its great value and its charming effects cannot be
realised. To do it rightly we must group and mass as Nature
does. Though we may enjoy a single flower or tuft here and
there, the true way is natural fringes and masses of plants,
one or two species prevailing in a given spot; in that way we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
may secure several important ends&mdash;distinct effects in different
places, a variety as we walk along, and better means of meeting
the wants of a plant, inasmuch as, dealing with a group, or
mass, or carpet, we can best observe the result of our judgment
in putting them in any soil or place. Therefore, although the
quantity of vigorous hardy flowers essential for making good
effects in a place of this size has not yet been planted out,
some very charming effects have been obtained. Among the
features that Mr. Berry is working to introduce are vigorous
hardy exotic creepers on old and inferior trees, Thorn, and
other bushes of little value. Many are already planted, but
will be some time before they show their full beauty&mdash;among
them Japanese and other Honeysuckles, Virginian Creepers,
Clematis, Wistarias, and others. A part of the arboretum is
more particularly devoted to this kind of decoration, and will
eventually form a very wild wood and wild garden, where
the Poet’s Narcissus may be found among Sweet Briers, Lilacs,
and many kinds of fragrant&ndash;flowering shrubs and vigorous
perennials. While carrying out the scheme of wild gardening,
pure and simple, that is to say, the naturalisation of foreign
hardy plants, opportunity has been taken to establish beautiful
native kinds where they do not happen to be present in sufficient
abundance. Thus the Lily of the Valley has been
brought in quantities and planted in wide&ndash;spreading colonies
along the drives, and so have the Meadow Saffron and the
Snowflakes and Daffodils. To group and scatter these in a
natural and easy way has required considerable care, the
tendency of the men being invariably, and almost in spite
of themselves, to plant in stiff and set or too regular masses.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Few things are more delightful to anybody who cares
about hardy plants than naturalising the Lily of the Valley
in pleasant spots about a country house. It is in every garden,
of course, and very often so crowded and so starved that
it seldom flowers well. A bare garden border is not so suitable
for it as that in which it may be found in a thin wood,
or in little openings in a copse, where it enjoys enough
light, and gets shelter too. Frequently the fresh wood soil
would be more welcome to it than the worn&ndash;out soil in a
garden; also by planting it in various positions and soils, we
may secure an important difference as regards blooming.
In a cool woody place it would bloom ten days later
than in an exposed warm garden border, and this difference
could be increased by carefully selecting the position. Apart
altogether from the wild garden and its charms, this difference
in the time of blooming of the Lily of the Valley would be a
great advantage to all who have to provide cut flowers, inasmuch
as it would give them late bloom in plenty without
trouble. However, giving reasons for the naturalisation of
the Lily of the Valley is surely unnecessary. The only surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
thing is that it has not been done to a large extent
already, because it is so very easy and so very delightful.
Recently a good many different varieties of Lily of the Valley&mdash;nearly
as many as twenty&mdash;have been collected, and are
beginning to be cultivated by some of our growers of herbaceous
plants. The difference in these is not owing to soil or situation.
When grown in the same place they manifest differences
in length of spike and size of foliage; and also in time
of blooming. In some the spike is short, and in others nearly
one foot long. This important fact should, of course, be noted
by any who would, in places where the Lily of the Valley
does not grow wild, interest themselves in establishing it.</p>

<p>There are advantages in wood&ndash;culture for many hardy
plants&mdash;the shelter, shade, and soil affording for some things
conditions more suitable than our gardens. The warmth of
the wood, too, is an advantage, the fallen leaves helping to
protect the plants in all ways. In a hot country plants that
love cool places could be grown in a wood where they would
perish if exposed. Mr. G. F. Wilson has made himself a
remarkably interesting and successful wild garden in a wood,
from which he sent me in the autumn of last year (1880) a
flowering stem of the American Swamp Lily (L. superbum)
<i>eleven feet high</i>. No such result has ever been seen in any
garden or border of the ordinary type. These Lilies of his
grow in a woody bottom where rich dark soil has gathered,
and where there is shelter and shade.</p>

<p>Placing every plant in one border with the same conditions
as to soil and exposure was a great mistake. A great
many beautiful plants haunt the woods, and we cannot change
their nature easily. Even if we should grow them in open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
places their bloom will not be so enduring as in the wood.
A curious instance of the advantage of planting in a wood is
at Bodorgan in Anglesey, where a much later bloom was
gathered off a colony of the popular Hoteia japonica, owing
to planting it in a cool wood. A little woodland planting
may indeed be worth doing for the sake of a prolonged or
later bloom, even from plants that thrive in sunny places.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Orchard Wild Garden.</span></h3>

<p>Although three years have elapsed since the illustrations
of this book were commenced, I regret to issue it without a
satisfactory one showing the beauty which may be obtained
in the orchard from flowers in the grass or fences around.
In our orchard counties&mdash;pity it is that all our counties are
not worthy of the name within the possibilities of their
position and climate&mdash;one may now and then see a cloud of
Daffodils or a tuft of Summer Snowflake, enough to suggest
what happy places they would be for many bulbous flowers
in the grass.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Wild Orchard.</span></h3>

<p>A correspondent of the “Garden” writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">After reading in the “Garden” of November 16, about the Bullace
there named, and the Cranberries, the idea struck me of adding unto
our Orchard in Sussex “a wild Orchard,” with fruit trees such as follows,
viz.&mdash;Quince, Medlar, Mulberry, Bullace, Crab, Pyrus Maulei, Barberries,
Blackberries (the large kinds for preserving), Filberts, and in a
suitable place, Cranberries. All these, besides the interest of cultivating
them, would yield fruit for preserving, etc. For instance, we have old&ndash;fashioned
receipts for making an excellent Bullace cheese, Crab jelly,
Quince jelly, etc. I venture to trouble you with a view to asking if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
you can suggest any other similar fruit&ndash;bearing trees or shrubs, as we
should like to carry out our idea well. Our house is in Sussex, between
Midhurst and Haslemere.&mdash;C. S. R.</p>

<p class="p1">[An excellent idea! There are many fruits which could
be grown this way that people do not usually give space to,
and this applies to the varieties of cultivated fruits, as well as
species that are never cultivated. The natural order to which
most of our fruit trees belong contains many other species, not
without merit as fruits, scattered throughout the temperate
regions of the northern world. These trees and shrubs happen
also to be most beautiful of flowering trees and shrubs in
spring, and are well worthy of culture on that account alone.
In Japan, North America, and even the continent of Europe,
one frequently sees fruits that are never seen in our gardens;
such fruits will be quite at home in the wild orchard. For
the sake of growing one family of fruiting bushes alone&mdash;the
fruiting brambles of America and other countries&mdash;a considerable
piece of ground might be profitably devoted. Even
amongst the English wild Blackberries there is considerable
variety and a good deal of unrecognised merit. Such plants
can only be grown fairly where there is considerable space.
If so much beauty and interest, and even good fruit, may be
found in one neglected family, it suggests how interesting the
subject is when considered in relation to the great number of
our hardy fruit trees and shrubs. A good feature of such a
garden would be plantations of such Apples and Pears as are
most remarkable for the beauty of their flowers and fruit,
some being much more striking in that respect than others.]</p>

<p class="pn">Nearly all
landscape gardeners
seem to
have put a
higher value on
the lake or fish&ndash;pond
than on
the brook as an
ornament to the
garden; but,
while we allow
that many places
are enhanced in
beauty and dignity,
by a broad
expanse of water,
many pictures
might be formed by taking advantage of a brook as it
meanders through woody glade or meadow. No such beauty
is afforded by a pond or lake, which gives us water in repose&mdash;imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
water, in fact; and although we obtain breadth
by confining water, still, in many cases, we prefer the brook, or
water in motion, as it ripples between mossy rocks or flower&ndash;fringed
banks. The brook&ndash;margin, too, offers opportunities to
lovers of hardy flowers which few other situations can rival.
Hitherto we have only used in and near such places aquatic
or bog plants, and of these usually a very meagre selection;
but the improvement of the brook&ndash;side will be most readily
effected by planting the banks with hardy flowers, making
it a wild garden, in fact. A great number of our finest herbaceous
plants, from Irises to Globe&ndash;flowers, thrive best in the
moist soil found in such positions; numbers of hardy flowers,
also, that do not in nature prefer such soil, would exist in
perfect health in it. The wild garden illustrated by the
water&ndash;side will give us some of the most charming garden
pictures. Land plants would have this advantage over water
ones, that we could fix their position, whereas water plants
are apt to spread everywhere, and sometimes one kind
exterminates the rest; therefore it might, in many cases, be
better not to encourage the water or water&ndash;side vegetation, but
to form little colonies of hardy flowers along the banks. The
plants, of course, should be such as would grow freely among
Grass and take care of themselves. If different types of
vegetation were encouraged on each side of the water, the
effect would be all the better. The common way of repeating
a favourite plant at intervals would spoil all: groups of
free hardy things, different in each place as one passed, would
be best; Day Lilies; Phloxes, which love moisture; Irises,
mainly the beardless kinds, which love wet places, but all
the fine Germanica forms will do; Gunnera; Aster; American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
swamp Lilies in peaty or boggy soil; the deep rose&ndash;coloured
variety of the Loosestrife; Golden Rods; the taller and stouter
Bell&ndash;flowers (Campanula); the Spider Wort (Tradescantia
virginica), of which there are a good many forms, differing
in colour; the Broad&ndash;leaved Saxifrages; the Compass plants
(Silphium); Everlasting Peas; Monkshood; the Goats Rues
(Galega); Baptisia; the free&ndash;flowering Yuccas; the hardiest
flame&ndash;flowers (Tritoma); the stouter kinds of Yarrow (Achillea);
the common perennial Lupin&mdash;these are some of many types
of hardy flowers which would grow freely near the water&ndash;side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
apart wholly from the plants that naturally frequent such
places or which are usually placed there. With these hardy
plants too, a variety of the nobler hardy ferns would thrive,
as the Struthiopteris; the finer types of the Umbellate order
(Ferula and others) would also come in well here. We will
now consider the plants that naturally belong to such situations
so to say.</p>

<p>Water&ndash;plants of northern and temperate regions, associated
with those of our own country, add much beauty to a garden
if well selected and well grown. A great deal of variety
may be added to the margins, and here and there to the surface,
of ornamental water, by the use of a good collection of
hardy aquatics arranged with taste; but this has not yet
been fairly attempted. Usually we see the same monotonous
vegetation all round the margin if the soil be rich; in some
cases, where the bottom is of gravel, there is little or no
vegetation, but an unbroken ugly line of washed earth between
wind and water. In others, water&ndash;plants accumulate
till they are only an eyesore&mdash;not submerged plants like
Anacharis, but such as the Water Lilies when matted together.
A well&ndash;developed plant or group of plants of the
queenly Water Lily, with its large leaves and noble flowers,
is an object not surpassed by any other in our gardens; but
when it increases and runs over the whole of a piece of water&mdash;thickening
together and being in consequence weakened&mdash;and
water&ndash;fowl cannot make their way through it, then even
this plant loses its charms. No garden water, however,
should be without a few fine plants or groups of the Water
Lily. Where the bottom does not allow of the free development
of the plant, earth might be accumulated in the spot
where it was desired to encourage the growth of the Nymphæa.
Thus arranged it would not spread too much. But it
is not difficult to prevent the plant from spreading; indeed
I have known isolated plants, and groups of it, remain of
almost the same size for years. The Yellow Water Lily,
Nuphar lutea, though not so beautiful as the preceding, is
well worthy of a place; and also the little N. pumila, a
variety or sub&ndash;species found in the lakes of the north of
Scotland.</p>

<p>Then there is the fine and large N. advena, a native of
America, which pushes its leaves boldly above the water, and
is very vigorous in habit. It is very plentiful in the Manchester
Botanic Garden, and will be found to some extent in
most gardens of the same kind. The American White Water
Lily (Nymphæa odorata) is a noble species, which would
prove quite hardy in Britain. It is a pity this noble aquatic
plant is not more frequently seen, as it is quite as fine as our
own Water Lily. Rose&ndash;coloured varieties are spoken of, but
are not yet in cultivation here.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest effects I have ever observed was
afforded by a sheet of Villarsia nymphæoides belting round
the margin of a lake near a woody recess, and before it, more
towards the deep water, a group of Water Lilies. The Villarsia
is a charming little water&ndash;plant, with its Nymphæa&ndash;like
leaves and numerous golden&ndash;yellow flowers, which furnish a
beautiful effect on fine days, under a bright sun. It is not
very commonly distributed as a native plant, though, where
found, generally very plentiful.</p>

<p>Not rare&mdash;growing, in fact, in nearly all districts of
Britain&mdash;but beautiful and singular, is the Buckbean or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Marsh Trefoil (Menyanthes trifoliata), with its flowers deeply
fringed on the inside with white filaments, and the round
unopened buds blushing on the top with a rosy red like that
of an Apple&ndash;blossom. It will grow in a bog or any moist
place, or by the margin of any water. For grace, no water&ndash;plant
can well surpass Equisetum Telmateia, which, in deep
soil, in shady and sheltered places near water, often grows
several feet high, the long, close&ndash;set, slender branches depending
from each whorl in a singularly graceful manner. It will
grow on the margins of lakes and streams, especially among
water&ndash;side bushes, or in boggy spots in the shade.</p>

<p>For a bold and picturesque plant on the margin of water,
nothing equals the great Water Dock (Rumex Hydrolapathum),
which is rather generally dispersed over the British
Isles; it has leaves quite sub&ndash;tropical in aspect and size,
becoming of a lurid red in the autumn. It forms a grand
mass of foliage on rich muddy banks, and, unlike many water&ndash;plants,
has the good quality of not spreading too much. The
Cat’s&ndash;tail (Typha) must not be omitted, but it should not be
allowed too much liberty. The narrow&ndash;leaved one (T.
angustifolia) is more graceful than the common one (T. latifolia).
Carex pendula is excellent for the margins of water,
its elegant drooping spikes being quite distinct in their way.
It is rather common in England, more so than Carex pseudocyperus,
which grows well in a foot or two of water or on the
margin of a muddy pond. Carex paniculata forms a strong
and thick stem, sometimes 3 ft. or 4 ft. high, somewhat like a
tree Fern, and with luxuriant masses of drooping leaves, and
on that account is transferred to moist places in gardens, and
cultivated by some, though generally these large specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
are difficult to remove and soon perish. Scirpus lacustris
(the Bulrush) is too distinct a plant to be omitted, as its
stems, sometimes attaining a height of more than 7 ft. and
even 8 ft., look very imposing; and Cyperus longus is also a
desirable plant, reminding
one of the aspect of the
Papyrus when in flower. It
is found in some of the
southern counties of England.
Poa aquatica might also be
used. Cladium Mariscus is
another distinct and rather
scarce British aquatic which
is worth a place.<span class="vh"><a name="ill73" id="ill73">ill73</a></span></p>

<p>If one chose to enumerate
the plants that grow in
British and European waters,
a very long list might be
made, but those which possess
no distinct character or
no beauty of flower would
be useless, for it is only by a judicious selection of the
very best kinds that gardening of this description can give
satisfaction; therefore, omitting a host of inconspicuous water&ndash;weeds,
we will endeavour to indicate others of real worth for
our present purpose.</p>

<p>Those who have seen the flowering Rush (Butomus umbellatus)
in blossom, are not likely to omit it from a collection of
water&ndash;plants, as it is conspicuous and distinct. It is a native
of the greater part of Europe and Russian Asia, and is dispersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
over the central and southern parts of England and
Ireland. Plant it not far from the margin, and it likes rich
muddy soil. The common Arrow Head (Sagittaria), very
frequent in England and Ireland, but not in Scotland, might
be associated with this; but there is a very much finer double
exotic kind, which is really a handsome plant, its flowers
white, and resembling, but larger than, those of the old white
Double Rocket. This used to be grown in abundance in the
pleasure gardens at Rye House, Broxbourne, where it filled a
sort of oblong basin, or wide ditch, and was very handsome in
flower. It forms large egg&ndash;shaped tubers, or rather receptacles
of farina, and in searching for these, ducks destroyed the
plants occasionally. Calla palustris is a beautiful bog&ndash;plant,
and I know nothing that produces a more pleasing effect over
rich, soft, boggy ground. It will also grow by the side of
water. Calla æthiopica, the well&ndash;known and beautiful Lily
of the Nile, is hardy enough in some places if planted rather
deep, and in nearly all it may be placed out for the summer;
but, except in quiet waters, in the south of England and Ireland,
it will not thrive. However, as it is a plant so generally
cultivated, it may be tried without loss in favourable positions.
Pontederia cordata is a stout, firm&ndash;rooting, and perfectly hardy
water&ndash;herb, with erect and distinct habit, and blue flowers,
not difficult to obtain from botanic garden or nursery. The
Sweet&ndash;flag will be associated with the Water Iris (I. Pseudacorus),
and a number of exotic Irises will thrive in wet
ground, <i>i.e.</i> I. sibirica, ochreleuca, graminea, and many others.
Aponogeton distachyon is a native of the Cape of Good Hope,
a singularly pretty plant, which is hardy enough for our
climate, and, from its sweetness and curious beauty, a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
desirable plant to cultivate. It frequently succeeds in water
not choked by weeds or foulness, and wherever there are
springs that tend to keep the water a little warmer than usual
it seems to thrive in any part of the country. The Water
Ranunculuses, which sheet over our pools in spring and early
summer with such silvery beauty, are not worth an attempt
at cultivation, so rambling are they; and the same applies to
not a few other things of interest. Orontium aquaticum is a
scarce and handsome aquatic for a choice collection, and as
beautiful as any is the Water Violet (Hottonia palustris). It
occurs most frequently in the eastern and central districts of
England and Ireland. The best example of it that I have
seen was on an expanse of soft mud near Lea Bridge, in Essex,
where it covered the surface with a sheet of dark fresh green,
and must have looked better in that position than when in
water, though doubtless the place was occasionally flooded.
A suitable companion for the Marsh Marigold (Caltha) and
its varieties is the very large and showy Ranunculus Lingua,
which grows in rich ground to a height of three feet or more.</p>

<p>If with this water&ndash;garden we combine the wild garden of
land plants&mdash;herbaceous, trailers, etc.&mdash;some of the loveliest
effects possible in gardens will be produced. The margins of
lakes and streams are happily not upturned by the spade in
winter; and hereabouts, just away from the water&ndash;line, almost
any vigorous and really hardy flower of the thousands now in
our gardens may be grown and will afterwards
take care of itself. The Globe&ndash;flowers
alone would form beautiful
effects in such positions, and
would endure as long as the Grass.
Near the various Irises that love
the water&ndash;side might be planted
those that thrive in moist
ground, and they are many,
including the most beautiful
kinds. Among recently introduced
plants the singular
Californian Saxifraga peltata
is likely to prove a noble
one for the water&ndash;side, its
natural habitat being beside
mountain watercourses, dry
in the autumn when it is
at rest; both flowers and foliage are effective, and the
growth very vigorous when in moist ground. It would
require a very long list to enumerate all the plants that
would grow near the margins of water, and apart from
the aquatics proper; but enough has been said to prove that,
given a strip of ground beside a stream or lake, a garden of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the most delightful kind could be formed. The juxtaposition
of plants inhabiting different situations&mdash;water&ndash;plants, water&ndash;side
plants, and land&ndash;plants thriving in moist ground&mdash;would
prevent what would, in many cases, be so undesirable&mdash;a
general admixture of the whole. Two distinct classes of effects
could be obtained, the beauty of the flowers seen close at
hand, and that of the more conspicuous kinds in the distance,
or from the other side of the water of a stream or lakelet.</p>

<p>An interesting point in favour of the wild garden is the
succession of effects which it may afford, and which are suggested
by the illustrations on the next pages, both showing a
succession of life on the same spot of ground. In gardens in
early summer at present the whole of the portion devoted
to flower&ndash;gardening is dug up raw as a ploughed field, just
when the earth is naturally most thickly strewn with flowers.
A very little consideration and observation will suffice to
make it clear that a succession of effects may be secured
without this violent disfigurement of our gardens in the
fairest days of early summer. These are not the days for
digging or planting either, and the system that necessitates
them is pernicious in its effects on our gardens.</p>

<p>It is equally an enemy of all peace or rest for the gardener,
who, having trenched, dug, enriched, planted, and sown,
through the autumn, winter, and spring, might certainly begin
to look for the fruits and flowers of his labour, when he has
to face the most trying effort of all&mdash;the planting of the
flower&ndash;garden in May and June with a host of flowers too
tender to be committed to the earth at an earlier season.</p>

<p>The bog&ndash;garden is a home for the numerous children of
the wild that will not thrive on our harsh, bare, and dry
garden borders, but must be cushioned on moss, and associated
with their own relatives in moist peat soil. Many beautiful
plants, like the Wind Gentian and Creeping Harebell, grow
on our own bogs and marshes, much as these are now
encroached upon. But even those acquainted with the beauty
of the plants of our own bogs have, as a rule, but a feeble notion
of the multitude of charming plants, natives of northern and
temperate countries, whose home is the open marsh or boggy
wood. In our own country, we have been so long encroaching
upon the bogs and wastes that some of us come to regard
them as exceptional tracts all over the world. But when one
travels in new countries in northern climes, one soon learns
what a vast extent of the world’s surface was at one time
covered with bogs. In North America day after day, even
by the margins of the railroads, one sees the vivid blooms
of the Cardinal&ndash;flower springing erect from the wet peaty
hollows. Far under the shady woods stretch the black bog&ndash;pools,
the ground between being so shaky that you move a
few steps with difficulty. One wonders how the trees exist
with their roots in such a bath. And where the forest vegetation
disappears the American Pitcher&ndash;plant (Sarracenia),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Golden Club (Orontium), Water Arum (Calla palustris), and
a host of other handsome and interesting bog&ndash;plants cover
the ground for hundreds of acres, with perhaps an occasional
slender bush of Laurel Magnolia (Magnolia glauca) among
them. In some parts of Canada, where the painfully long
and straight roads are often made through woody swamps,
and where the few scattered and poor habitations offer little
to cheer the traveller, he will, if a lover of plants, find conservatories
of beauty in the ditches and pools of black
water beside the road, fringed with the sweet&ndash;scented Buttonbush,
with a profusion of stately ferns, and often filled with
masses of the pretty Sagittarias.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Southwards and seawards, the bog&ndash;flowers become tropical
in size and brilliancy, as in the splendid kinds of herbaceous
Hibiscus, while far north, and west and south along the
mountains, the beautiful and showy Mocassin&ndash;flower (Cypripedium
spectabile) grows the queen of the peat bog. Then
in California, all along the Sierras, there are a number of
delicate little annual plants growing in small mountain bogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
long after the plains have become quite parched, and annual
vegetation has quite disappeared from them. But who shall
record the beauty and interest of the flowers of the wide&ndash;spreading
marsh&ndash;lands of this globe of ours, from those of the
vast wet woods of America, dark and brown, and hidden
from the sunbeams, to those of the breezy uplands of the high
Alps, far above the woods, where the little bogs teem with
Nature’s most brilliant flowers, joyous in the sun? No one
worthily; for many mountain&ndash;swamp regions are as yet as
little known to us as those of the Himalaya, with their giant
Primroses and many strange and lovely flowers. One thing,
however, we may gather from our small experiences&mdash;that
many plants commonly termed “alpine,” and found on high
mountains, are true bog&ndash;plants. This must be clear to anyone
who has seen our pretty Bird’s&ndash;eye Primrose in the wet
mountain&ndash;side bogs of Westmoreland, or the Bavarian Gentian
in the spongy soil by alpine rivulets, or the Gentianella
(Gentiana acaulis) in the snow ooze.</p>

<p>Bogs are neither found or desired in or near our gardens
now&ndash;a&ndash;days, but, wherever they are, there are many handsome
flowers from other countries that will thrive in them as freely
as in their native wastes.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">ROSES FOR THE WILD GARDEN, AND FOR HEDGEROWS,
FENCES, AND GROUPS.</p>


<p class="pn">The wild Roses of the world, had we no other plants, would
alone make beautiful wild gardens. The unequalled grace of
the Wild Rose is as remarkable as the beauty of bloom for
which the Rose is grown in gardens. The culture is mostly
of a kind which tends to conceal or suppress the grace of
shoot and foliage of the Rose. Therefore the wild garden
may do good work in bringing before the many who love
gardens, but have fewer chances of seeing the Roses in their
native haunts, the native grace of the well&ndash;loved Rose, which
even in its obesity, and trained into the form of a mop, still
charms us. The Rev. H. N. Ellacombe writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I have here a very large and thick Box bush, in the centre of
which there has been for many years an Ayrshire Rose. The long
branches covered with flowers, and resting on the deep green cushion,
have a very beautiful effect. Other Roses may be used in the same
way. The Musk Rose of Shakespeare and Bacon would be particularly
well suited for this, and would climb up to a great height. Rosa
scandens or sempervirens, Rosa multiflora, and perhaps some others,
might be grown in the same way; and it would be worth while to
experiment with other garden forms, such as Aimée Vibert, purple
Boursault, etc. If grown against a tree of thin foliage, such as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Robinia, they would grow quicker and flower sooner; but this is not
necessary, for even if grown near a thick&ndash;foliaged tree they will soon
bring their branches to the outside for the light. But besides climbing
Roses, there is another way in which Roses may be combined with
trees to great advantage, viz. by planting some of the taller&ndash;growing
bushes in rough grassy places. These would grow from 6 feet to 10
feet high, and would flower well in such a position. For such a
purpose the old Dutch Apple Rose (Rosa villosa var. pomifera) would
be very suitable, and so would R. cinnamomea, R. fraxinifolia, R.
gallica, R. rubifolia, and the common monthly China. And if growers
would rear the perpetual and other Roses by autumnal cuttings instead
of by budding, they might have hundreds and thousands of fine Roses
which would do well planted in the woods and plantations.</p>

<p class="p1">Another correspondent, Mr. Greenwood Pim, writes referring
to the preceding note:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I have two large exotic Hawthorns&mdash;round&ndash;headed standards,
growing close together, so that their edges touch, forming, as it were,
two gentle hills with a valley between, and sloping down to within
about 6 ft. of the lawn. Of these one is Cratægus Crus&ndash;galli; the
other C. tanacetifolia. Behind, and partly through these, climbs a very
old Noisette Rose&mdash;all that now remains of an arched trellis&mdash;producing
a vast number of bunches of white flowers, six or eight together, and
about 1½ in. or 2 in. across. The old gnarled stem of the Rose is
scarcely noticeable amongst those of the Thorns till it reaches the top
of them, whence it descends between the trees in a regular torrent of
blossom, in addition to occupying the topmost boughs of the Cockspur
Thorn. The general effect is almost that of a large patch of snow
between two bright green hills&mdash;a combination very common in the
higher districts of Switzerland. A smaller plant of the same Rose has
recently been trained up a large Arbor&ndash;vitæ which, from moving, has
lost its lower branches for some 4 ft. or 5 ft., and has its stem clothed
with Ivy. It is now festooned with snowy flowers hanging down from
and against the dark green of the Arbor&ndash;vitæ and Ivy, forming a
charming contrast. It seems a great pity that we do not oftener thus
wed one tree to another&mdash;a stout and strong to a slender and clinging
one, as Virgil in the “Georgics” talks of wedding the Vine to the Elm,
as is, I believe, done to this day in Italy.<span class="vh"><a name="ill83" id="ill83">ill83</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“We have,” says a correspondent, “a pretty extensive collection
of
Roses, but
one of the
most attractive
specimens
on the
place is an
old double
white Ayrshire
Rose,
growing in
a group
of common
Laurel in the
shrubberies.
We cannot
tell how old
the plant
may be, but
it has probably
been in
its present
situation for
thirty years,
struggling
the best way
it could to
keep its
place among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the tall&ndash;growing Laurels, sometimes sending out a shoot
of white flowers on this side and sometimes on that
side of the clump of bushes, and sometimes scrambling
up to the tops of the tallest limbs and draping them
with its blossoms throughout June and July. Nearly
three years ago we had the Laurels headed down to within
six feet of the ground, leaving the straggling limbs of the
Rose which were found amongst them, and since then it has
grown and thriven amazingly, and now fairly threatens to
gain the mastery. We had the curiosity to measure the
plant the other day, and found it rather over seventy feet in
circumference. Within this space the plant forms an irregular
undulating mound, nearly in all parts so densely covered with
Roses that not so much as a hand’s breadth is left vacant anywhere,
and the Laurel branches are quite hidden, and in fact
are now dying, smothered by the Rose. A finer example of
luxuriant development we never saw. The plant has been a
perfect sheet of bloom for a month or more, and there are
thousands of buds yet to expand, and hundreds of bunches of
buds have been cut just at the opening stage&mdash;when they are
neater and whiter than a Gardenia&mdash;to send away. The tree
has never received the least attention or assistance with the
exception of the removal of the Laurel tops before mentioned,
to let the light into it. It is growing in a tolerably deep and
strong dry loam, and this, together with head room, seems to
be all it requires. We record this example simply to show
of what the Rose is capable without much cultural assistance.
No doubt, in order to produce fine individual blooms certain
restricted culture is necessary; but almost any variety of
Rose will make a good&ndash;sized natural bush of itself, and as for
the climbing or pillar Roses, the less they are touched the
better. Of course we are not alluding to the Rosery proper,
but of Roses in their more natural aspect, as when planted to
hide fences, cover rockeries, or as striking objects on lawns.
Except against walls, and in similar situations, there is no
occasion to prune climbing Roses. Left to themselves, they
make by far the grandest display, and to insure this it is only
necessary to provide them with a good, deep, strong soil at
the beginning, and to let them have a fair amount of light on
all sides. Whether planting be carried out with the object
above described, or for the purpose of covering naked tree
stumps or limbs, or for draping any unsightly object whatever,
liberal treatment in the first instance is the main thing. A
good soil makes all the difference in time and in the permanent
vigour of the tree, and were we desirous of having a
great Rose tree (whether it be a common Ayrshire or a Gloire
de Dijon, that we expected to produce thousands of blooms in
a few years), we should, if the soil were not naturally strong
and deep, provide a well&ndash;drained pit and fill it with two or
three good cartloads of sound loam and manure; thus treated,
the result is certain, provided an unrestricted growth be permitted.”</p>

<p>Roses on grass are a pleasant feature of the wild garden.
No matter what the habit of the rose, provided it be free and
hardy, and growing on its own roots, planting on the grass
will suit it well. So treated, the more vigorous climbers
would form thickets of flowers, and graceful vigorous shoots.
They will do on level grass, and be still more picturesque on
banks or slopes.</p>

<p>The following description, by Mr. E. Andre, of Roses in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the Riviera is suggestive of what we may obtain in our
own climate later, by using the free kinds on their own roots,
or on stocks equally hardy and not less vigorous, as in the
case of the Banksian Roses mentioned below:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">On my last excursion from Marseilles to Genoa, I was greatly
struck, as any one seeing them for the first time would be, with the
magnificence of the Roses all along the Mediterranean shores. The
Rose hedges, and the espalier Roses, especially, offer an indescribably
gorgeous sight. Under the genial influence of the warm sun of Provence,
from the Corniche to the extremity of the Riviera di Ponente,
that is as far as the Gulf of Genoa, and protected to the north by the
mountains, which gradually slope down to the sea&ndash;coast, Roses attain
the size of Pæonies, and develop a depth and brilliancy of colour and
fragrance of unusual intensity. But this is in part due to another
cause, or rather two other causes, which lead to the same result, the
main point being the choice of suitable subjects for stocks to graft
upon. These stocks are, Rosa Banksiæ and Rosa indica major. The
Banksian Rose presents three varieties, namely, White Banksian, producing
a profusion of small white flowers, scarcely so large as those of
the double&ndash;flowered Cherry, and of a most delicious fragrance; Yellow
Banksian, with still larger clusters of small nankeen&ndash;yellow scentless
flowers; Chinese Thorny Banksian, flowers less numerous and about
three times as large as in the two preceding, and of the most grateful
odour. These three forms attain an unsurpassable vigour in this region.
In two years one plant will cover an immense wall, the gable of a house,
or climb to the top of a tall tree, from which its branches hang like
flowery cascades, embalming the air around with a rich perfume during
the months of April and May. Now, if these be taken for stocks upon
which to bud some of the choicer Teas, Noisettes, and Bourbons, the
growth of the latter will be prodigious. The stock should be two years
old, having well ripened, though still smooth, wood. In this way such
varieties as Gloire de Dijon, Maréchal Niel, Lamarque, Safrano, Chromatella,
Aimée Vibert, le Pactole, and all the Teas, attain such dimensions
as to be no longer recognisable.</p>

<p class="pbq">Rosa indica major is almost naturalised throughout the whole of
this region. It possesses the additional claim to favour of flowering
nearly all the winter, forming beautiful hedges of dark green shining
foliage, from which thousands of clusters of lovely flowers rise, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
tender delicate transparent pink, or almost pure white, with a brighter
tinge in the centre and at the tips of the petals. This Rose is an evergreen,
and makes an excellent stock for grafting or budding. It is
either planted in nursery beds, where it quickly throws up a stem suitable
for standards in the same way as we employ the Dog Rose, or in
hedges, and left to its naturally luxuriant growth to produce its own
charming flowers in rich profusion, or rows of cuttings are put in where
it is intended to leave them, and subsequently budded with some of the
varieties of the diverse tribes we have named.</p>

<p class="pn">There are many hundred species
of mountain and rock plants
which will thrive much better
on an old wall, a ruin, a sunk
fence, a sloping bank of
stone, with earth behind,
than they do in the most
carefully prepared border,
and therefore their culture
may be fittingly considered
here, particularly, as once
established in such positions
they increase and take care
of themselves unaided. Indeed,
many an alpine plant
which may have perished
in its place in the garden,
would thrive on any old wall near at hand, as, for example,
the pretty Pyrenean Erinus, the silvery Saxifrages of the
Alps, pinks like the Cheddar Pink, established on the walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
at Oxford, many Stonecrops and allied plants, the Aubrietia
and Arabis.</p>

<p>A most interesting example of wall gardening is shown
on the opposite page. In the gardens at Great Tew,
in Oxfordshire, this exquisite little alpine plant, which
usually roots over the moist surface of stones, established
itself high up on a wall in a small recess, where half a brick
had been displaced. The illustration tells the rest. It is
suggestive, as so many things are, of the numerous plants
that may be grown on walls and such unpromising surfaces.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Cheddar Pink, Saxifrage, and Ferns, on cottage wall at Mells.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A mossy old wall, or an old ruin, would afford a position
for many rock&ndash;plants which no specially prepared situation
could rival; but even on well&ndash;preserved walls we can
establish some little beauties, which year after year will
abundantly repay for the slight trouble of planting or sowing
them. Those who have observed how dwarf plants grow on
the tops of mountains, or on elevated stony ground, must
have seen in what unpromising positions many flourish in
perfect health&mdash;fine tufts sometimes springing from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
almost imperceptible chink in an arid rock or boulder. They
are often stunted and diminutive in such places, but always
more long&ndash;lived than when grown vigorously upon the
ground. Now, numbers of alpine plants perish if planted in
the ordinary soil of our gardens, and many do so where much
pains is taken to attend to their wants. This results from
over&ndash;moisture at the root in winter, the plant being rendered
more susceptible of injury by our moist green winters
inducing it to make a lingering growth. But it is interesting
and useful to know that, by placing many of these delicate
plants where their roots can secure a comparatively dry and
well&ndash;drained medium, they remain in perfect health. Many
plants from latitudes a little farther south than our own, and
from alpine regions, may find on walls, rocks, and ruins, that
dwarf, ripe, sturdy growth, stony firmness of root medium, and
dryness in winter, which go to form the very conditions that
will grow them in a climate entirely different from their own.</p>

<p>In many parts of the country it may be said with truth
that opportunities for this phase of gardening do not exist; but
in various districts, such as the Wye and other valleys, there
are miles of rock and rough wall&ndash;surface, where the scattering
of a few pinches of Arabis, Aubrietia, Erinus, Acanthus,
Saxifrage, Violas, Stonecrops, and Houseleeks, would give rise
to a garden of rock blossoms that would need no care from
the gardener. Growing such splendid alpine plants as the
true Saxifraga longifolia of the Pyrenees on the straight surface
of a wall is quite practicable. I have seen the rarest
and largest of the silvery section grown well on the face of a
dry wall: therefore there need be no doubt as to growing the
more common and hardy kinds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>A few seeds of the Cheddar Pink, for example, sown in a
mossy or earthy chink, or even covered with a dust of fine
soil, would soon take root, living for years in a dwarf and
perfectly healthful state. The seedling roots vigorously into
the chinks, and gets a hold which it rarely relaxes. A list of
many of the plants which will grow on walls will be found
among the selections near the end of the book.</p>

<p class="pch">SOME RESULTS.</p>

<p class="pn">In addition to Longleat, and other cases previously mentioned,
a few of the results obtained, where the system
was tried, and so far as known to me, may not be without
interest. How much a wild garden intelligently and tastefully
carried out may effect for a country seat is fairly
well shown in a garden in Oxfordshire. Here is one of
the earliest, and probably one of the largest wild gardens
existing, and which, visiting it on the 27th May, I found
full of novel charms. No old&ndash;fashioned garden yields its
beauty so early in the year, or over a more prolonged season,
than the wild garden, as there is abundant evidence here;
but our impressions shall be those of the day only. It
may serve to throw light on the possibilities of garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
embellishment in one way at a season when there is a great
blank in many gardens&mdash;the time of “bedding out.” The
maker of this had no favourable or inviting site with
which to deal; no great variety of surface, which makes
attempts in this direction so much easier and happier; no
variety of soil, which might enable plants of widely different
natural habitats to be grown; only a neglected plantation,
with rather a poor gravelly soil and a gentle slope in one
part, and little variety of surface beyond a few gravel banks
thrown up long before. The garden is, for the most part,
arranged on each side of a Grass drive among rather open
ground, few trees on the one hand and rather shady ground
on the other. The most beautiful aspect at the end of May
of a singularly ungenial spring, which had not allowed the
Pæonies to unfold, was that of the German Irises, with
their great Orchid&ndash;like blossoms seen everywhere through
the wood, clear above the Grass and other herbage, stately
and noble flowers that, like the Daffodils, fear no weather,
yet with rich and delicate hues that could not be surpassed
by tropical flowers. If this wild garden only should teach
this effective way of using the various beautiful and vigorous
kinds of Iris now included in our garden flora, it would do
good service. The Irises are perfectly at home in the wood
and among the Grass and wild flowers. By&ndash;and&ndash;by, when
they go out of flower, they will not be in the way as in a
“mixed border,” tempting one to remove them, but grow and
rest quietly among the grass until the varied blossoms of
another year again repay the trouble of substituting these
noble hardy flowers for some of the familiar weeds and wild
plants that inhabit our plantations.<span class="vh"><a name="ill94" id="ill94">ill94</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>In the wild garden the fairest of our own wild flowers
may be happily associated with their relatives from other
countries. Here the sturdy Bell&ndash;flowered Scilla (S. campanulata)
grows wild with our own Bluebell (S. nutans); the
white and pink forms also of the last&ndash;named look beautiful
here associated with the common well&ndash;known form. The
earlier Scillas are of course past; they are admirably suited
for the wild garden, especially S. bifolia, which thrives freely
in woods. The Lily of the Valley did not inhabit the wood
before; therefore it
was pleasant to thin
out some of its over&ndash;matted
tufts and carry
them to the wild
garden, where they
are now in fullest
beauty. It is associated with its tall and
stately relation the Solomon’s Seal. The
Solomon’s Seal, which is usually effective
when issuing forth from fringes of shrubberies,
is here best arching high over the Woodruff
and other sweet woodland flowers, among
which it seems a giant, with every leaf, and stem, and blossom
lines of beauty. The additional vigour and beauty shown by
this plant when in rich soil well repays one for selecting suitable
spots for it. The greater Celandine (Chelidonium majus) and its
double form are very pretty here with their tufts of golden
flowers; they grow freely and take all needful care of themselves.
The same may be said of the Honesty, the common
forms of Columbine, and Allium Moly, an old&ndash;fashioned plant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and one of the many subjects at home in the wild garden, and
which are better left out of the garden proper. The myriads
of Crocus leaves dying off without the indignity of being tied
into bundles as is common in gardens, the dense growth of
Aconite and Snowdrop leaves, of coloured and common
Primroses and Cowslips, suggest the beauty of this wild
garden in spring. The yet unfolded buds on the many tufts
and groups of the numerous herbaceous Pæonies, promise
noble effects early in June; so do the tufts of the splendid
Eastern Poppy (Papaver orientale) and the Lilies, and Sweet
Williams, and Adam’s Needles, and many other subjects,
that will show their blossoms above or among the summer
Grass in due time. Among the best of the Borageworts
here at present, are the Caucasian Comfrey (Symphytum
caucasicum), an admirable wood or copse plant, and red&ndash;purple
or Bohemian Comfrey (S. bohemicum), which is very
handsome here. And what lovely effects from the Forget&ndash;me&ndash;nots&mdash;the
wood Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not, and the Early Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not
(M. dissitiflora) are here! where their soft little clouds of
blue in the Grass are much prettier than tufts of the same
kind surrounded by the brown earth in a prim border. Here
the pushing of the delicate Grass blades through the blue
mass and the indefinite way in which the fringes of the tufts
mingle with the surrounding vegetation are very beautiful.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Large&ndash;leafed Saxifrage in the Wild Garden.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The only noticeable variation of surface is that of some
gravel banks, which are properly covered with Stonecrops,
Saxifrages, and the like, which would, as a rule, have a poor
chance in the Grass. Surfaces that naturally support a very
sparse and dwarf vegetation are valuable in a garden, as they
permit of the culture of a series of free&ndash;growing alpine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rock plants that would not be able to hold their own among
Grass and ordinary weeds and wild flowers. One of the
happiest features of this wild garden results from the way
in which dead trees have been adorned. Once dead, some
of the smaller branches are lopped off, and one or more
climbers planted at the base of the tree. Here a Clematis,
a climbing Rose, a new kind of Ivy, a wild Vine, or a
Virginian Creeper, have all they require, a firm support on
which they may arrange themselves after their own natural
habit, without being mutilated, or without trouble to the
planter, and fresh ground free to themselves. What an
admirable way, too, of growing the many and varied species
of Clematis! as beautiful as varieties with flowers as large as
saucers. Even when an old tree falls and tosses up a mass
of soil and roots the wild gardener is ready with some
subject from his mixed border to adorn the projection, and
he may allow some choice Bramble or wild Vine to scramble
over the prostrate stem. A collection of Ivies grown on old
tree&ndash;stems would be much more satisfactory than on a wall,
and not liable to robe each other at the roots, and interfere
with each other in the air. Ferns are at home in the wild
garden; all the strong hardy kinds may be grown in it, and
look better in it among the flowers than in the “hardy
Fernery” properly so called. Even more graceful than the
Ferns, and in some cases more useful, because they send up
their plume&ndash;like leaves very early in the year, are the giant
Fennels (Ferula), which grow well here, and hold their own
easily among the strongest plants. The common Fennel is
also here, but it seeds so freely that it becomes a troublesome
weed, and shows a tendency to overrun plants of greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
value. This reminds us of certain subjects that should be
introduced with caution into all but the remotest parts of the
wild garden. Such plants as Heracleum, Willow Herb, and
many others, that overcome all obstacles, and not only win
but destroy all their fellows in the struggle for life, should
only be planted in outlying positions, islands, hedges, small
bits of isolated wood or copse, where their effects might be
visible for a season, and where they might ramble without
destroying. In short, they never should be planted where
it is desired to encourage a variety of beautiful subjects.
Rabbits&mdash;dreaded vermin to the wild gardener&mdash;are kept
out here effectually by means of wire fencing. The presence
of these pests prevents all success in the wild garden. The
encouragement of creatures that feed on slugs is desirable, as
these are the most potent cause of mischief to hardy flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
To succeed with the wild garden, one should have a good
collection of hardy flowers from which it can be supplied.
Here one has been formed, consisting of about 1100 species,
mostly arranged in borders. From these, from time to time,
over&ndash;vigorous and over&ndash;abundant kinds may be taken to the
wilderness. In a large collection one frequently finds species
most suited for full liberty in woods. The many subjects
good in all positions, may increase in these borders till
plentiful enough for planting out in some quantity in the
wild garden. The wild garden here has been wholly formed
by the owner, who planted with his own hands the various
subjects that now adorn it throughout the year. It has
been done within four or five years, and therefore many of
the climbers have not as yet attained full growth.</p>

<p>Tew Park will long be interesting, from the fact that it
was there J. C. Loudon practised agriculture before he began
writing the works which were such a marked addition to the
horticultural literature of England. The Grove there is a
plantation of fine trees, bordering a wide sweep of grass,
which varies in width. This grove, unlike much of the rest
of the ground, does not vary in surface, or but very little, so
that one of the greatest aids is absent. Originally this now
pleasant grove was a dense wood, with Gout&ndash;weed mainly on
the ground, and troublesome flies in the air. A few years
ago the formation of a wild garden was determined upon, and
the first operation was the thinning of the wood; light and
moving air were let into it, and weak or overcrowded trees
removed. This, so far, was a gain, quite apart from the
flowers that were in good time to replace the few common
weeds that occupied the ground. Of these the unattractive
Gout&ndash;weed was the most abundant, and the first thing to do
was to dig it up. It was found that by deeply digging the
ground, and sowing the wood Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not in its place, this
weed disappeared. Who would not exchange foul weeds for
Lilies of the Valley and Wood Forget&ndash;me&ndash;nots! The effect of
broad sheets of this Wood Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not (Myosotis sylvatica)
beyond, and seen above the long waving Grass gradually
receding under the trees, was very beautiful; now (June) its
beauty is not so marked as earlier, when the colour was fuller,
from the plants being more compact; but one charm of the
wild garden is that the very changes of plants from what may
be thought their most perfect state, may be in itself the
source of a new pleasure instead of a warning, such as so
often occurs in the garden, that we must cut them down or
replace them.</p>

<p>Not to mow is almost a necessity in the wild garden:
considering that there is frequently in large gardens much
more mown surface than is necessary, many will not regret
this need. Here the Grass is designedly left unmown in
many places, and thereby much labour is saved. Of course
it may be cut when ripe, and most of the spring flowers have
past and their leaves are out of danger; even in parts where
no flowers are planted the Grass is left till long enough to cut
as meadow. Except where actually required as a carpet, Grass
may often be allowed to grow even in the pleasure ground;
quite as good an effect is afforded by the unmown as the mown
Grass&mdash;indeed, better when the long Grass is full of flowers.
Three&ndash;fourths of the most lovely flowers of cold and temperate
regions are companions of the Grass&mdash;like Grasses in hardiness,
like Grasses in summer life and winter rest, like them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
even in stature. Whatever plants may seem best to associate
with in gardens, an immense number&mdash;more than two
thousand species of those now cultivated&mdash;would thrive to
perfection among our meadow Grasses, as they do on the
Grassy breast of the mountain in many lands. Some, like
the tall Irises or Columbines, will show their heads clear
above the delicate bloom of the Grass; others, like the
Cerastiums, will open their cups below it, in this way
multiplying the variety of effects that may be obtained.
The varieties of Columbine in the Grass were perhaps the
prettiest flowers at the time of my visit. The white, purplish,
and delicately&ndash;variegated forms of this charming old plant,
just seen above the tops of the long Grass, growing singly,
in little groups, or in spreading colonies, were sufficient in
themselves to form a wild garden for June. Established
among the Grass, they will henceforward, like it, take care of
themselves. The rosy, heart&ndash;shaped blooms of the Dielytra
spectabilis are recognised at some distance through the Grass,
and, so grown, furnish a bright and peculiarly pretty effect.
Tree Pæonies succeed admirably, and their great heads of
flower quite light up this charming wilderness. Plants of the
Goat’s Beard Spiræa (S. Aruncus) are very stately and graceful,
even now, before their flowering, being quite 6 ft. high.
In a few weeks, when the numerous flowers are open, they
will present quite another aspect. In the wild garden, apart
from the naturalisation of free&ndash;growing exotics, the establishment
of rare British flowers is one of the most interesting
occupations; and here, under a Pine tree, the modest, trailing
Linnæa borealis of the northern Fir&ndash;woods is beginning
to spread. The Foxglove was not originally found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
neighbourhood; now the ordinary kind and the various other
forms of this fine wild flower adorn the woods. In this way
also the Lily of the Valley has been introduced and is spreading
rapidly. Many climbing Roses and various other climbers
have been planted at the bases of trees and stumps, but,
though thriving, the plantation is as yet too young to show
the good effect that these will eventually produce. There is
no finer picture at present to be seen in gardens than a free&ndash;growing
flowering creeper, enjoying its own wild way over an
old tree or stump, and sending down a rain of flower&ndash;laden
shoots. A Clematis montana here, originally trained on a
wall, sent up some of its shoots through a tree close at hand,
where, fortunately, they have been allowed to remain, and
now the long shoots hang from the tree full of flowers. The
large plumes of the nobler hardy Ferns are seen here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
there through the trees and Grass, and well they look&mdash;better
here among the Grass and flowers, partially shaded by trees,
than in the hardy Fernery, which is so often a failure, and
when a success, often “too much of a muchness,” so to say.
The wild garden of the future will be also the true home of
all the more important hardy Ferns. The rivals of the Ferns
in beauty of foliage, the Ferulas, and various other umbelliferous
plants with beautifully cut foliage, have also their
homes in the wild garden. The Welsh Poppy thrives, as
might be expected, admirably in the grove, its rich yellow
cups just showing above the meadow.</p>

<p>In another part of the grounds there is a raised walk
quite away from trees, open and dry, with sloping banks on
each side. This may be called a sun&ndash;walk, and here quite a
different type of vegetation is grown; Scotch Roses, Brooms,
Sun Roses, Rock Roses, etc. It is quite recently formed, and
will probably soon accommodate a more numerous and interesting
flora. Such an open sunny walk, with dry banks near, is
a capital position in which to carry out various phases of the
wild garden. Peculiarly suitable, however, in such a position
is a good illustration of the vegetation of the hot, rocky, and
gravelly hill&ndash;sides of the Mediterranean region, and this is
quite easily represented, for the various leguminous plants
and dwarf Pea&ndash;flowered shrubs, such as the Spanish Broom,
many of the beautiful Rock Roses (Cistus), the Sun Roses
(Helianthemum), and the Lavenders, will, with a host of companions,
for the most part thrive quite as well on a sunny
sandy bank in England as in Italy or Greece. In the wild
garden it is easy to arrange aspects of vegetation having a
geographical interest, and a portion of such a sunny bank as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
I allude to might be worthily furnished with the various
aromatic plants (nearly all hardy) which one meets with on
the wild hill&ndash;sides of Southern France, and which include
Thyme, Balm, Mint, Rosemary, Lavender, and various other
old garden favourites.</p>

<p>True taste in the garden is unhappily much rarer than
many people suppose. No amount of expense, rich collections,
good cultivation, large gardens, and plenty of glass, will
suffice; all these and much more it is not difficult to see, but
a few acres of garden showing a real love of the beautiful in
Nature, as it can be illustrated in gardens, is rare, and when it
is seen it is often rather the result of accident than design.
This is partly owing to the fact that the kind of knowledge
one wants in order to form a really beautiful garden is very
uncommon. No man can do so with few materials. It is
necessary to have some knowledge of the enormous wealth
of beauty which the world contains for the adornment of
gardens; and yet this knowledge must not have a leaning, or
but very partially, towards the Dryasdust character. The
disposition to “dry” and name everything, to concern oneself
entirely with nomenclature and classification, is not in accordance
with a true gardening spirit&mdash;it is the <i>life</i> we want.
The garden of the late Mr. Hewittson, at Weybridge, contained
some of the most delightful bits of garden scenery
which I have ever seen. Below the house, on the slope over
the water of Oatlands Park, and below the usual lawn beds,
trees, etc., there is a piece of heathy ground which, when we
saw it, was charming beyond any power of the pencil to show.
The ground was partially clad with common Heaths with
little irregular green paths through them, and abundantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
naturalised in the warm sandy soil were the Sun Roses,
which are shown in the foreground of the plate. Here and
there among the Heaths, creeping about in a perfectly
natural&ndash;looking fashion, too, was the Gentian blue Gromwell
(Lithospermum prostratum), with other hardy plants suited
to the situation. Among these naturalised groups were the
large Evening Primroses and Alstr&oelig;meria aurea, the whole
being well relieved by bold bushes of flowering shrubs, so
tastefully grouped and arranged as not to show a trace of
formality. Such plants as these are not set out singly and
without preparation, but carefully planted in beds of such
naturally irregular outline, that when the plants become
established they seem native children of the soil, as much as
the Bracken and Heath around. It is remarkable how all
this is done without in the least detracting from the most
perfect order and keeping. Closely&ndash;shaven glades and wide
Grass belts wind about among such objects, while all trees
that require special care and attention show by their health and
size that they find all they require in this beautiful garden.
It is more free from needless or offensive geometrical&ndash;twirling,
barren expanse of gravelled surface, and all kinds of puerilities&mdash;old&ndash;fashioned
and new&ndash;fangled&mdash;than any garden I have
seen for years.</p>

<p>The following, from a correspondent, shows what may be
done with few advantages as to space or situation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">We have a dell with a small stream of spring water running
through it. When I first came to Brockhurst I found this stream
carried underground by a tile culvert, and the valley sides covered
with Rhododendrons, the soil between carefully raked and kept free
from weeds, so that it was only during springtime that flowers relieved
the sombre effect of this primness. After five years this has all been
changed into what I think you would call a wild garden, and we
have cheerfulness and beauty all the year round.</p>

<p class="pbq">In the first place the brooklet was brought to the surface, and its
course fringed with marsh plants, such as Marsh Marigolds, Forget&ndash;me&ndash;nots,
Celandines, Irises, Primroses, and Ranunculuses, together
with Osmundas, Hart’s&ndash;tongues, and other Ferns. Many large&ndash;growing
Carexes and ornamental Rushes are also here. Little flats were formed
and filled with peat, in which Cypripediums, Trilliums, Orchises,
Solomon’s Seal, and many rare bog plants find a home. In the valley
we have planted bulbs by thousands&mdash;Crocuses, Snowdrops, Daffodils,
Narcissi, etc. The Rhododendrons were thinned and interspersed with
Azaleas, Aucubas, and other handsome&ndash;foliaged shrubs, to give brightness
to the spring flowering, and rich colour to the foliage in autumn.
In the spaces between we introduced wild Hyacinths everywhere, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
in patches amongst these the Red Campion, together with every other
pretty wild flower we could obtain&mdash;Forget&ndash;me&ndash;nots, Globe&ndash;flowers,
Columbines, Anemones, Primroses, Cowslips, Polyanthuses, Campanulas,
Golden Rods, etc. All the bulbs which have bloomed in the greenhouses
are planted out in these spaces, so that there are now large
clumps of choice sorts of Crocus, Tulip, Narcissus, and Hyacinth. We
have also planted bulbs very extensively, and as they have been
allowed to grow on undisturbed we have now large patches of Daffodils,
Narcissi, and other spring flowers in great beauty and exuberance.
When we trim the garden all the spare plants are brought here, where
they form a reserve, and it is thus gradually getting stocked, and all
the bare ground covered with foliage and flowers. Lastly, for autumn
blooming we raised large quantities of Foxgloves in every colour, and
the larger Campanulas, and these were pricked out everywhere, so that
we have a glorious show of Foxglove flowers to close the year worth all
the trouble. A wild garden of this sort is a very useful reserve
ground, where many a plant survives after it has been lost in the
borders. Such spare seedlings as the Aquilegias, Campanulas, Primulas,
Trolliuses, and other hardy plants can here find space until wanted
elsewhere, and one can frequently find blooms for bouquets in the
dell when the garden flowers are over. The Lily of the Valley and
Sweet Violet also flourish here, creeping over heaps of stones, and
flower more freely than they do in more open situations. Visitors
often say that the dell beats all the rest of the garden for beauty, and
it certainly gives less trouble in the attainment.</p>

<h3>THE WILD GARDEN IN AMERICA.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">[2]</span></a></h3>

<div class="pbq">
<p>Probably many of your readers will ask, “What <i>is</i> a wild garden?”
When I came to London, about fifteen years ago, “flower&ndash;gardening”
had but one mode of expression only, viz. “bedding out,” and that in its
harshest form&mdash;ribbons, borders, and solid masses of flowers of one
colour and one height. The old hardy flowers had been completely
swept away; the various and once popular race of so&ndash;called florist’s flowers
were rarely or never seen. As a consequence, gardens were indescribably
monotonous to any person with the faintest notion of the inexhaustible
charms of the plant world. This kind of flower&ndash;gardening
has the same relation to true art in a garden which the daubs of colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
on an Indian’s blanket have to the best pictures. In fighting, some
years later, in the various journals open to me, the battle of nature
and variety against this saddening and blank monotony, I was occasionally
met by a ridicule of the old&ndash;fashioned mixed border which the
bedding plants had supplanted. Now, a well&ndash;arranged and varied
mixed border may be made one of the most beautiful of gardens; but
to so form it requires some knowledge of plants, as well as good taste.
Nevertheless, the objection was just as concerned the great majority of
mixed borders; they were ragged, unmeaning, and even monotonous.</p>

<p>I next began to consider the various ways in which hardy plants
might be grown wholly apart from either way (the bedding plants or
that of the mixed border), and the <i>wild garden</i>, or garden formed in
the wilderness, grove, shrubbery, copse, or rougher parts of the pleasure
garden, was a pet idea which I afterwards threw into the form of a
book with this name. In nearly all our gardens we have a great deal
of surface wholly wasted&mdash;wide spaces in the shrubbery frequently
dug over in the winter, plantations, grass&ndash;walks, hedgerows, rough
banks, slopes, etc., which hitherto have grown only grass and weeds,
and on these a rich garden flora may be grown. Hundreds of the
more vigorous and handsome herbaceous plants that exist will thrive
in these places and do further good in exterminating weeds and preventing
the need of digging. Every kind of surface may be embellished
by a person with any slight knowledge of hardy plants&mdash;ditch&ndash;banks,
gravel&ndash;pits, old trees, hedge&ndash;banks, rough, grassy places that are never
mown, copses, woods, lanes, rocky or stony ground.</p>

<p>The tendency has always been to suppose that a plant from
another country than our own was a subject requiring much attention,
not thinking that the conditions that occur in such places as mentioned
above, are, as a rule, quite as favourable as those that obtain
in nature throughout the great northern regions of Europe, Asia, and
America. Here some common plants of the woods of the Eastern
States are considered rarities and coddled accordingly to their destruction.
It is quite a phenomenon to see a flower on the little Yellow
Dog’s&ndash;Tooth Violet, which I remember seeing in quantity among the
grass in your noble Central Park. When one has but a few specimens
of a plant, it is best no doubt to carefully watch them. But an
exposed and carefully dug garden border is the worst place to grow
many wood and copse plants (I mean plants that grow naturally in
such places), and in many uncultivated spots here the American
Dog’s&ndash;Tooth Violet would flower quite as freely as at home. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
beautiful little May&ndash;flower, Epigæa repens, we have never succeeded in
growing in our best American nurseries, as they are called, which
grow your Rhododendrons and other flowering shrubs so well. If a
number of young plants of this were put out in a sandy fir&ndash;wood,
under the shrubs and pines, as they grow in New Jersey, we should
succeed at once. Your beautiful Trillium grandiflorum is usually
seen here in a poor state; but I have seen a plant in a shady position
in a shrubbery, in rich, moist soil, quite two feet through and two
feet high.</p></div>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill108" id="ill108">ill108</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p>I mention these things to show that the wild garden may even
have advantages from the point of view of cultivation. Another
advantage is the facilities it affords us for enjoying representations of
the vegetation of other countries. Here, for example, the poorest soil
in the most neglected copse will grow a mixture of golden rods and
asters, which will give us an aspect of vegetation everywhere seen in
American woods in autumn. This to you may appear a very commonplace
delight; but as we have nothing at all like it, it is welcome.
Besides, we in this way get the golden rods and coarser asters out of
the garden proper, in which they used to overrun the choicer plants,
and where they did much to disgrace the mixed border. So, in like
manner, you may, in New England or New Jersey, make wild gardens
of such of our English flowers as you love. For example, the now
numerous and very handsome varieties of our Primroses, Polyanthuses,
and Oxlips would probably succeed better with you in moist places, in
woods, or partially shaded positions, than in the open garden. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
can be no doubt in which position they would look best. But let us
suppose for a moment that there was no other object for the wild
garden in America than growing the many lovely wild flowers that
inhabit the land, it is sufficient. Here some of your wildlings are the
darlings of our rock&ndash;garden growers, though we are far from possessing
all the bright flowers and graceful trailers that adorn the bogs and
woods and heaths of the Eastern States. It would be most wise, in
case of possessing a little bit of wood or copse, adorned naturally with
the trailing Partridge Berry, and the rosy Lady’s Slipper (Cypripedium
acaule), which I noticed growing so plentifully, to preserve the spot
as a wild garden, and add to it such home and foreign, free and
handsome hardy plants, as one could obtain.</p>

<p>It is impossible in this letter to speak of the various kinds of
wild gardens, but the opportunity which the system offers for embellishing
cool shady places is one which should make it interesting
to the people to whose language belongs the term “shade trees.”
Usually flower beds and borders are in the full sun&mdash;a very proper
arrangement in a cool country. But even in our climate, there are in
the warm months many days in which the woodland shade is sought
in preference to the open lawn, and when the fully&ndash;exposed garden is
deserted. Therefore, it is clearly desirable that we have flowers in
shady as well as sunny places. Many plants, too, love the shade, and
we only require to plant the most suitable of these to enjoy a charming
wild garden. It need not be pointed out to Americans that a vast
number of herbaceous plants naturally inhabit woods. In America,
where shade is such a necessity, the wild garden in the shade will be
the most delightful retreat near the country house. In it many of the
plants common in the gardens of all northern countries will, without
wearisome attention, flower in the spring.</p>

<p>For the early summer months flowers of a somewhat later period
will be selected, as, for example, the later Irises&mdash;lovely hardy flowers,
the tall Asphodel A. ramosus, the Day Lilies (Hemerocallis), the
Solomon’s Seal and some of its allies, the Veronicas, tall Phloxes, the
great Scarlet Poppy (Papaver bracteatum), Symphytums in variety;&mdash;these
are all free&ndash;growing and admirable plants for the wild wood&ndash;garden.
Mulleins (Verbascum), Salvias, Harebells (Campanula), Willow herbs,
tall Lupines, Geraniums, Spurges, Meadow Rues, Columbines, Delphiniums,
and the latest wind flowers (Anemone).</p>

<p>Later still, and in the sunny days, would come the various beautiful
everlasting peas, various plants of the Mallow tribe, the Poke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Weeds, broad&ndash;leaved Sea Lavender, and other vigorous kinds, the Globe
Thistles, Acanthuses, the free&ndash;flowering Yuccas, such as Y. flaccida and
Y. filamentosa, the common Artichoke, with its noble flowers; and in
autumn, a host of the Golden Rods and Michaelmas Daisies. These
are so common in America that adding them to the wild garden would
probably be considered a needless labour; but the substitution of the
various really beautiful species of aster for those commonly found and
of inferior beauty would well repay. In case it were thought desirable
in making a wild garden in a shady position to grow plants that
do not attain perfection in such positions, they might be grown in the
more open parts at hand, and sufficiently near to be seen in the picture.</p></div>

<i>Sketched in winter of 1879.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p class="pn">In the winter season,
or indeed at
any other season,
one of the most
melancholy things
to be seen in our
parks and gardens
are the long, bare,
naked shrubberies,
extending, as along
the Bayswater
Road, more or less
for a mile in a place; the soil greasy, black, seamed with the
mutilated roots of the poor shrubs and trees; which are
none the better, but very much the worse, for the cruel
annual attention of digging up their young roots without
returning any adequate nourishment or good to the soil.
Culturally, the whole thing is suicidal, both for trees and
plants. The mere fact of men having to pass through one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of those shrubberies every autumn, and, as they fancy,
“prune” and otherwise attend to unfortunate shrubs and
low trees, leads to this, and especially to the shrubs taking
the appearance of inverted besoms. Thus a double wrong is
done, and at great waste of labour. Any interesting life that
might be in the ground is destroyed, and the whole appearance
of the shrubbery is made hideous from the point of view
of art; all good culture of flowering or evergreen shrubs
destroyed or made impossible. This system is an orthodox
one, that has descended to us from other days, the popular
idea being that the right thing to do in autumn is to dig the
shrubbery. The total abolition of this system, and the adoption
of the one to be presently described, would lead to the
happiest revolution ever effected in gardening, and be a perfectly
easy, practicable means for the abolition of the inverted
besoms, and the choke&ndash;muddle shrubbery, and these awful
wastes of black soil and mutilated roots.</p>

<p>Two ideas should be fixed in the mind of the improver,
the one being to allow all the beautiful shrubs to assume
their natural shapes, either singly or in groups, with sufficient
space between to allow of their fair development, so that the
shrubbery might, in the flowering season, or indeed at all
seasons, be the best kind of conservatory&mdash;a beautiful winter
garden even, with the branches of most of the shrubs touching
the ground, no mutilation whatever visible, and no hard dug
line outside the shrubs. This last improvement could easily
be effected by forming a natural fringe, so to say, by breaking
up the usual hard edge from good planting; by letting, in
fact, the edge be formed by well&ndash;furnished shrubs projected
beyond the hard line, and running in and out as they do on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hill copse, or as the box bushes sometimes do on a Sussex
down. Here care, variety in selection, taste and skill in
grouping, so as to allow different subjects, whether placed
singly or in groups, or little groves, being in a position where
they may grow well and be seen to advantage, would lead
to the most charming results in the open&ndash;air garden. With
sufficient preparation at first, such shrubberies would be the
cause of very little trouble afterwards.</p>

<p>Now, such beauty could be obtained without any further
aid from other plants; and in many cases it might be desirable
to consider the trees and shrubs and their effect only,
and let the turf spread in among them; but we have the
privilege of adding to this beautiful tree and shrub life
another world of beauty&mdash;the bulbs and herbaceous plants,
and innumerable beautiful things which go to form the
ground flora, so to say, of northern and temperate countries,
and which light up the world with loveliness in meadow
or copse, or wood or alpine pasture in the flowering season.
The surface which is dug and wasted in all our parks, and
in numbers of our gardens, should be occupied with this
varied life; not in the miserable old mixed border fashion,
with each plant stuck up with a stick, but with the plants in
groups and colonies between the shrubs. In the spaces where
turf would not thrive, or where it might be troublesome to
keep fresh, we should have irises, or narcissi, or lupines, or
French willows, or Japan anemones, or any of scores of other
lovely things which people cannot now find a place for in our
stiff gardens. The soil which now does little work, and in
which the tree&ndash;roots every year are mercilessly dug up,
would support myriads of lovely plants. The necessity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
allowing abundant space to the shrubs and trees, both in the
young and the adult stage, gives us some space to deal with,
which may be occupied with weeds if we do not take care of
it. The remedy, then, is to replace the weed by a beautiful
flower, and to let some handsome hardy plant of the northern
world occupy each little space; keeping it clean for us, and, at
the same time, repaying us by abundant bloom, or fine foliage
or habit. This system in the first place allows the shrubs
themselves to cover the ground to a great extent. In the
London parks now every shrub is cut under so as to allow
the digger to get near it; and this leads to the most comical
and villainous of shapes ever assumed by bushes. Even the
lilac bushes, which we see so horribly stiff, will cover the
ground with their branches if allowed room enough; therefore,
to a great extent, we should have the branches themselves
covering the ground instead of what we now see. But
open spaces, little bays and avenues running in among the
shrubs, are absolutely essential, if we want to fully enjoy
what ought to be the beautiful inhabitants of our shrub
garden. Such openings offer delightful retreats for hardy
flowers, many of which thrive better in semi&ndash;shady spots
than they do in the open, while the effect of the flowers is
immeasurably enhanced by the foliage of the shrubs around.
To carry out this plan well, one should have, if possible, a
good selection of the shrubs to begin with, although the
plainest shrubbery, which is not overgrown or overcrowded,
may be embellished with hardy plants on the ground. The
plan may be adopted in the case of new shrubberies being
formed, or in the case of old ones; though the old ones are
frequently so dried up and overcrowded that great alterations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
would have to be made here and there. In the case of
young shrubberies it is, of course, necessary at first to keep
the surface open for a while until the shrubs have taken hold
of the ground; then the interesting colonies to which we
alluded may be planted.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Colony of the Snowdrop&ndash;Anemone in Shrubbery not dug. Anemone taking

</div></div>

<p>An essential thing is to abolish utterly the old dotting
principle of the mixed border, as always ugly and always bad
from a cultural point of view. Instead of sticking a number
of things in one place, with many labels, and graduating them
from the back to the front, so as to secure the stiffest imaginable
kind of arrangement, the true way is to have in each
space wide colonies or groups of one kind, or more than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
kind. Here is a little bay, for example, with the turf running
into it, a handsome holly feathered to the turf forming one
promontory, and a spreading evergreen barberry, with its fine
leaves also touching the ground, forming the other. As the
turf passes in between those two it begins to be colonised
with little groups of the pheasant’s&ndash;eye Narcissus, and soon in
the grass is changed into a waving meadow of these fair flowers
and their long grayish leaves. They carry the eye in among
the other shrubs, and perhaps carry it to some other colony
of a totally different plant behind&mdash;an early and beautiful
boragewort, say, with its bright blue flowers, also in a
spreading colony. Some might say, Your flowers of narcissi
only last a certain time; how are you going to replace them?
The answer is, that they occupy, and beautifully embellish, a
place that before was wholly naked, and worse than naked,
and in this position we contend that our narcissi should be
seen in all their stages of bud and bloom and decay without
being hurried out of the world as soon as their fair bloom is
over, as they are on the border or in the greenhouse. They
are worth growing if we only secure this one beautiful aspect
of vegetation where before all was worse than lost. We also
secure plenty of cut flowers without troubling the ordinary
resources of the garden.</p>

<p>We might then pass on to another, of the German iris,
occupying not only a patch, but a whole clump; for these
enormous London parks of ours have acres and acres on
every side of this greasy dug earth which ought to sparkle
with flowers; and, therefore, a very fine plant might be
seen to a large extent. And how much better for the
gardener or cultivator to have to deal with one in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
place than be tormented with a hundred little “dots” of
flowers&mdash;alpine, rock, wood, copse, or meadow plants&mdash;all
mixed up in that usually wretched soup called the “mixed
border”! No plants that require staking ought to be used
in the way we are speaking of. Day lilies, for example,
are good plants. In some bold opening what a fine effect
we could get by having a spreading colony of these therein;
scores of plants might be named, that want no sticking, for
such places. Each plant having a sufficient space and
forming its own colony, there is much less doubt in case
of alterations as to what should be done. In fact, in the
case of an intelligent cultivator, there should be no doubt.
Observe the advantage of this plan. Instead of seeing the
same plants everywhere, we should pass on from narcissi to
iris, from iris to bluebell, and thus meet with a different kind
of vegetation in each part of the park or garden, instead of the
eternal monotony of privet and long dreary line of “golden&ndash;feather”
everywhere. The same kind of variety, as suggested
for the flowers, should be seen among the shrubs. The
sad planter’s mixture&mdash;privet, laurel, etc.&mdash;taking all the
colour and all the life and charm out of the shrubbery, should
be avoided; so, too, the oppressive botanical business, with
everything labelled, and plants classified out of doors as they
are in an herbarium. They should be put where they would
look well and grow best. Well carried out, such a system
would involve labour, and, above all things, taste at first; but
it would eventually resolve itself into the judicious removal
of interloping weeds. The labour that is now given to dig
and mutilate once a year and keep clean at other times of the
year would easily, on the plan proposed, suffice for a much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
larger area. More intelligence would certainly be required.
Any ignorant man can dig around and mutilate a shrub and
chop up a white lily if he meets it! But any person taught to
distinguish between our coarse native weeds and the beautiful
plants we want to establish, passing round now and then,
would keep all safe.</p>

<p>On a large scale, in the London parks, such a plan would
be impossible to carry out without a nursery garden; that is
to say, the things wanted should be in such abundance, that
making the features of the kind we suggest would be easy
to the superintendent. The acres and acres of black surface
should themselves afford here and there a little ground
where the many hardy plants adapted for this kind of gardening
might be placed and increased. This, supposing that a
real want of the public gardens of London&mdash;a large and well&ndash;managed
nursery in the pure air&mdash;is never carried out: the
wastefulness of buying everything they want&mdash;even the
commonest things&mdash;is a costly drawback to our London
public gardens. At the very least we should have 100
acres of nursery gardens for the planting and replanting of
the London parks. So, too, there ought to be intelligent
labour to carry out this artistic planting; and with the now&ndash;awakened
taste for some variety in the garden, one cannot
doubt that a few years will give us a race of intelligent
young men, who know a little of the plants that grow in
northern countries, and whose mental vision is not begun
and ended by the ribbon border.</p>

<p>The treatment of the margin of the shrubbery is a very
important point here. At present it is stiff&mdash;the shrubs cut
in or the trees cut in, and an unsightly border running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
straight along, perhaps with a tile edging. Well, the right
way is to have a broken margin, to let the shrubs run in and
out themselves, and let them form the margin; let them
come to the ground in fact, not stiffly, and here and there
growing right outside the ordinary boundary, in a little group.
Throw away altogether the crowded masses of starved privet
and pruned laurel, and let the turf pass right under a group
of fine trees where such are found. This turf itself might be
dotted in spring with snowdrops and early flowers; nothing,
in fact, would be easier than for any intelligent person, who
knew and cared for trees and shrubs, to change the monotonous
wall of shrubbery into the most delightful of open&ndash;air gardens;
abounding in beautiful life, from the red tassels on the topmost
maples to flowers in the grass for children.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF HARDY EXOTIC FLOWERING
PLANTS FOR THE WILD GARDEN.</p>

<p class="pn2">Wherever there is room, these plants should be at first
grown in nursery beds to ensure a good supply. The number
of nursery collections of hardy plants being now more numerous
than they were a few years ago, getting the plants is not
so difficult as it once was. The sources of supply are these
nurseries; seed houses, who have lists of hardy plant seeds&mdash;many
kinds may be easily raised from seed; botanic gardens,
in which many plants are grown that hitherto have not
found a place in our gardens, and were not fitted for any
mode of culture except that herein suggested; orchards and
cottage gardens in pleasant country places may supply
desirable things from time to time; and those who travel
may bring seeds or roots of plants they meet with in cool,
temperate, or mountain regions. Few plants, not free of
growth and hardy in the British Islands without any attention
after planting, are included here:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><b>Bear’s Breech</b>, <i>Acanthus</i>.&mdash;Vigorous perennials with noble foliage,
mostly from Southern Europe. Long cast out of gardens, they are
now beginning to receive more of the attention they deserve. In no
position will they look better than carelessly planted here and there
on the margin of a shrubbery or thicket, where the leaves of the
Acanthus contrast well with those of the ordinary shrubs or herbaceous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
vegetation. Though quite hardy in all soils, they flower most freely
in free loamy soils. Not varying very much in character, all obtainable
hardy species would group well together. The most vigorous
kind at present in cultivation is one called A. latifolius, almost evergreen,
and a fine plant when well established. Few plants are more
fitted for adorning wild and semi&ndash;wild places, as they grow and
increase without care, and are for foliage or bloom unsurpassed by any
of the numerous plants that have been so long neglected through their
not being available in
any popular system of
“flower gardening.”<span class="vh"><a name="ill121" id="ill121">ill121</a></span></p></div>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc" style="max-width: 250px;">The Monkshood, naturalised by wet ditch in wood.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Monkshood</b>, <i>Aconitum</i>.&mdash;These
are
tall, handsome perennials,
with very poisonous
roots, which make
it dangerous to plant
them in or near
gardens. Being usually
very vigorous in constitution,
they spread
freely, and hold their
own amongst the
strongest herbaceous
plants and weeds;
masses of them seen
in flower in copses or
near hedgerows afford a
very fine effect. There
are many species, all
nearly of equal value
for the wild garden.
Coming from the plains
and mountains of Siberia and Northern Europe and America, they are
among the hardiest of plants. When spreading groups of Aconites are in
bloom in copses or open spaces in shrubberies, their effect is far finer
than when the plants are tied into bundles in trim borders. The old
blue&ndash;and&ndash;white kind is charming in half&ndash;shady spots, attaining stately
dimensions in good soil. The species grow in any soil, but are often
somewhat stunted in growth on clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Bugle</b>, <i>Ajuga</i>.&mdash;Not a very numerous family so far as represented
in gardens, but some of the species are valuable for the wild garden,
notably Ajuga genevensis, which thrives freely in ordinary soils in
open and half&ndash;shady places among dwarf vegetation, and affords
beautiful tufts and carpets of blue. It spreads rapidly and is hardy
everywhere. The plants mostly come from the cool uplands and hills
of the temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>

<p><b>Yarrow</b>, <i>Achillea</i>.&mdash;A numerous family of hardy plants spread
through Northern Asia, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Hungary, etc., but
more in Southern than in Central or Northern Europe. In the Alps
and Pyrenees numerous species are found. The Golden Yarrows (A.
Eupatorium and A. filipendulina) are stately herbaceous plants, with
broad handsome corymbs of brilliantly showy flowers, attaining a height
of 3 feet or 4 feet, and growing freely in any soil. These are well
worthy of naturalisation. Various other Achilleas would grow
quite as well in copses and rough places as the common Yarrow,
but we know of none more distinct and brilliant than the preceding.
The vigorous white&ndash;flowering kinds are superb for shrubberies, where
their numerous white heads of flowers produce a singularly pleasing effect
under the trees in summer. With few exceptions these plants have
never been grown out of botanic gardens, many of them being thought
too coarse for the mixed border. They are, nevertheless, remarkably
beautiful both in flower and foliage, and many effects never before seen
in gardens may be obtained by massing them under trees in shrubberies
or copses, as a rule allowing one species to establish itself in each place
and assume an easy natural boundary of its own. The small Alpine
species would be interesting plants for stony or bare rocky places.</p>

<p><i>Allium.</i>&mdash;A most extensive genus of plants scattered in abundance
throughout the northern temperate and alpine regions of Europe and
Asia, and also in America. Some of the species are very beautiful,
so much so as to claim for them a place in gardens notwithstanding
their disagreeable odour. It is in the wild garden only, however, that
this family can find a fitting home; there species that do not seem
attractive enough for the garden proper would afford novel effects at
certain seasons. One of the most desirable effects to produce in the
wild garden would be that of the beautiful white Narcissus&ndash;like Allium
of the south of Europe (A. neapolitanum). The sheets of this in the
Lemon orchards of Provence will be remembered with pleasure by
many travellers. It would thrive in warm and sandy soils: there is an
allied species (A. ciliatum) which does well in any soil, affords a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
similar effect, and produces myriads of star&ndash;like white flowers.
Numerous singular effects may be produced from species less showy
and more curious and vigorous, as for example the old yellow A. Moly.</p></div>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill123" id="ill123"></a></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">The white Narcissus&ndash;like Allium, in the orchards of Provence; type
of family receiving little place in gardens which may be beautiful
for a season in wild places.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><i>Alstr&oelig;meria.</i>&mdash;All who care for hardy flowers must admire the
beauty of Alstr&oelig;meria aurantiaca, especially when it spreads into bold
healthy tufts, and when there is a great variety in the height of the
flowering stems. A valuable quality of the plant is, that in any light
soil it spreads freely, and it is quite hardy. For dry places between
shrubs, for dry or sandy banks (either wooded or bare), copses, or
heathy places, this plant is admirable. I have noticed it thriving in
the shade of fir trees. It is interesting as being a South American
plant, thriving in any open soil.</p>

<p><b>Marsh Mallow</b>, <i>Althæa</i>.&mdash;These are plants rarely seen out of
botanic gardens now&ndash;a&ndash;days, and yet, from their vigour and showy
flowers, they may afford unique effects in the wild garden. The
common Hollyhock is an Althæa, and in its single form is typical
of the vigorous habit and the numerous showy flowers of other rampant
species, such as A. ficifolia. A group of these plants would be
very effective seen from a wood walk, no kind of garden arrangement
being large enough for their extraordinary vigour. It is not a numerous
genus, but there are at least a dozen species, principally found on
the shores and islands of the Mediterranean, and also in Western Asia.</p>

<p><i>Alyssum.</i>&mdash;In spring every little shoot of the wide tufts and flakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of these plants sends up a little fountain of small golden flowers. For
bare, stony, or rocky banks, poor sandy ground, and ruins, they are
admirable. Alyssum Wiersbecki and A. saxatile are strong enough
to take care of themselves on the margins of shrubberies, etc., where
the vegetation is not very coarse, but they are more valuable for rocky
or stony places, or old ruins, and thrive freely on cottage garden walls
in some districts; some of the less grown species would be welcome
in such places. There are many species, natives of Germany, Russia,
France, Italy, Corsica, Sicily, Hungary, and Dalmatia; Asia, principally
Siberia, the Altai Mountains, Georgia, Persia, and the entire basin of
the Caspian, is rich in them.</p></div>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">The Alpine Windflower (Anemone alpina).</p>
</div></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Windflower</b>, <i>Anemone</i>.&mdash;A numerous race of dwarf herbs that
contribute largely to the most beautiful effects of the mountain, wood,
and pasture vegetation of all northern and temperate climes. The
flowers vary from intense scarlet to the softest blue; most of the exotic
kinds would thrive as well in our woodlands and meadows as they do
in their own. There is hardly a position they may not adorn&mdash;warm,
sunny, bare banks, on which the Grecian A. blanda might open its
large blue flowers in winter; the tangled copse, where the Japan
Windflower and its varieties might make a bold show in autumn;
and the shady wood, where the Apennine Windflower would contrast
charmingly with the Wood Anemone so abundantly scattered in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
own woods. The Hepaticas should be considered as belonging to the
same genus, not forgetting the Hungarian one, A. angulosa. The
Hepaticas thrive best and are seen best in half&ndash;woody places, where the
spring sun may cheer them by passing through the branches, which afterwards
become leafy and shade them from the scorching heats of summer.</p>

<p><b>St. Bruno’s Lily</b>, <i>Anthericum</i>.&mdash;One of the most lovely aspects
of vegetation in the alpine meadows of Europe is that afforded by the
delicate white flowers of the St. Bruno’s Lily in the Grass in early
summer, looking like miniature white Lilies. All who have seen it
would no doubt like to enjoy the same in their turfy lawns or Grassy
places, and there should be no difficulty in establishing it. The large&ndash;flowered
or major variety might be tried with advantage in this way,
and the smaller&ndash;flowered kinds, A. Liliago and its varieties, are equally
suitable. They are not so likely to find favour in gardens as the larger
kind, and therefore the wild garden is the home for them, and in it
many will admire their graceful habit and numerous flowers. All the
species best worth growing are natives of the alpine meadows of Europe.</p>

<p><b>Alkanet</b>, <i>Anchusa</i>.&mdash;Tall and handsome herbaceous plants, with
numerous flowers of a fine blue, admirable for dotting about in open
places in sunny glades in woods or copses. They mostly come from
Southern Europe and Western Asia. A. italica and A. capensis are
among the most useful. The English Anchusa sempervirens, rare in
some places, is an excellent wild garden plant.</p>

<p><b>Snapdragon</b>, <i>Antirrhinum</i>.&mdash;The common Snapdragon and its
beautifully spotted varieties are easily naturalised on old walls and
ruins by sowing the seed in old or mossy chinks. Antirrhinum
Asarinum, rupestre, and molle do well treated in the same way.
Probably many other species would be found good in like places.
About two dozen species are known, but comparatively few of these are
in cultivation. They mostly come from the shores of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><b>Columbine</b>, <i>Aquilegia</i>.&mdash;Favourite herbaceous plants, generally
of various shades of blue and purple, white, and sometimes bright
orange. The varieties of the common kind (A. vulgaris), which are
very numerous, are those most likely to be naturalised. In elevated
and moist districts some of the beautiful Rocky Mountain kinds would
be worth a trial in bare places. In places where wild gardens have
been formed the effect of Columbines in the Grass has been one of the
most beautiful that have been obtained. The flowers group themselves
in all sorts of pretty ways, showing just above the long Grass, and
possessing great variety of colour. The vigorous and handsome A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
chrysantha of Western America is the most hardy and enduring of
the American kinds. The species are of a truly northern and alpine
family, most abundant in Siberia.<span class="vh"><a name="ill126" id="ill126">ill126</a></span></p></div>

</div></div>

<div class="pbq">

<p><b>Wall Cress</b>, <i>Arabis</i>.&mdash;Dwarf alpine plants, spreading in habit,
and generally producing myriads of white flowers, exceedingly suitable
for the decoration of sandy or rocky ground, where the vegetation is
very dwarf. With them may be associated Cardamine trifolia and
Thlaspi latifolium,
which resemble the
Arabises in habit and
flowers. All these are
particularly suited for
association with the
purple Aubrietias, or
yellow Alyssums, and
in bare and rocky or
gravelly places, old walls,
sunk fences, etc.</p>

<p><b>Sandwort</b>, <i>Arenaria</i>.&mdash;A
most important
family of plants
for the wild garden,
though perhaps less so
for lowland gardens
where more vigorous
types flourish. There
are, however, certain
species that are vigorous
and indispensable, such
as A. montana and
A. graminifolia. The
smaller alpine species
are charming for rocky
places, and the little creeping A. balearica has quite a peculiar
value, inasmuch as moist rocks or stones suffice for its support.
It covers such surfaces with a close carpet of green, dotted with
numerous star&ndash;like flowers. Some of the smaller species, such as
Arenaria cæspitosa (Sagina glabra var.), better known as Spergula
pilifera, might be grown in the gravel, and even used to convert
bare and sandy places into carpets of Mossy turf. In certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
positions in large gardens it would be an improvement to allow
the very walks or drives to become covered with very dwarf
plants&mdash;plants which could be walked upon with little injury. The
surface would be dry enough, being drained below, and would be
more agreeable to the feet. Removing any coarse weeds that established
themselves would be much easier than the continual hoeing and scraping
required to keep the walk bare. Of course this only refers to walks in
rough or picturesque
places&mdash;the wild garden
and the like&mdash;in
which formal bare
walks are somewhat
out of place.<span class="vh"><a name="ill127" id="ill127">ill127</a></span></p></div>

<div class="floatright">

         title="" />
     <div class="cf"><p class="pc">Tall Asphodel in copse.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="pbq">

<p><b>Asphodel</b>, <i>Asphodelus</i>.&mdash;The
Asphodels
are among the plants
that have never been
popular in the mixed
border, nor are they
likely to be so, the
habit of the species
being somewhat coarse
and the flowering period
not long, and yet they
are of a stately and
distinct order of beauty,
which well deserves to
be represented in open
spaces, in shrubberies,
or on their outer fringes.
The plants are mostly
natives of the countries
round the Mediterranean, and thrive freely in ordinary soils.</p>

<p><b>Lords and Ladies</b>, <i>Arum</i>.&mdash;Mostly a tropical and sub&ndash;tropical
family, some of which grow as far north as southern Europe. These
are quite hardy in our gardens. The Italian Arum is well worthy of
a place in the wild garden, from its fine foliage in winter. It should
be placed in sheltered half&ndash;shady places where it would not suffer
much from storms. The old Dragon plant (A. Dracontium) grows
freely enough about the foot of rocks or walls in sandy, or dry, peaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
places. The nearly allied Arum Lily (Calla æthiopica) is quite hardy
as a water and water&ndash;side plant in the southern counties of England
and Ireland.</p>

<p><b>Silkweed</b>, <i>Asclepias</i>.&mdash;Usually vigorous perennials, with very
curious and ornamental flowers, common in fields and on river banks
in North America and Canada, where they sometimes become troublesome
weeds. Of the species in cultivation, A. Cornuti and A. Douglasi
could be naturalised easily in rich deep soil in wild places. The
showy and dwarfer Asclepias tuberosa requires very warm sand soils
to flower as well as in its own dry hills and fields. A good many of
the hardy species are not introduced; for such the place is the wild
garden. Some of them are water&ndash;side plants, such as A. incarnata, the
Swamp Silkweed of the United States.</p>

<p><b>Starwort</b>, <i>Aster</i>.&mdash;A very large family of usually vigorous, often
showy, and sometimes beautiful perennials, mostly with bluish or
white flowers, chiefly natives of North America. Many of these, of an
inferior order of beauty, used to be planted in our mixed borders,
which they very much helped to bring into discredit, and they form a
very good example of a class of plants for which the true place is the
copse, or rough and half&ndash;cared&ndash;for places in shrubberies and copses, and
by wood&ndash;walks, where they will grow as freely as any native weeds,
and in many cases prove highly attractive in late summer and autumn.
Such kinds as A. pyrensæus, Amellus, and turbinellus, are amongst the
most ornamental perennials we have. With the Asters may be grouped
the Galatellas, the Vernonias, and also the handsome and rather dwarf
Erigeron speciosus, which, however, not being so tall, could not fight
its way among such coarse vegetation as that in which the Asters may
be grown. Associated with the Golden Rods (Solidago)&mdash;also common
plants of the American woods and copses&mdash;the best of the Asters or
Michaelmas Daisies will form a very interesting aspect of vegetation.
It is that one sees in American woods in late summer and autumn
when the Golden Rods and Asters are seen in bloom together. It is
one of numerous aspects of the vegetation of other countries which the
“wild garden” will make possible in gardens. To produce such effects
the plants must, of course, be planted in some quantity in one part of
a rather open wood, and not repeated all over the place or mixed up
with many other things. Nearly 200 species are known, about 150
of which form part of the rich vegetation of North America. These
fine plants inhabit that great continent, from Mexico&mdash;where a few are
found&mdash;to the United States and Canada, where they abound, and even
up to the regions altogether arctic of that quarter of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Milk Vetch</b>, <i>Astragalus</i>.&mdash;An enormously numerous family of
beautiful hardy plants, represented to but a very slight extent in our
gardens, though hundreds of them are hardy, and many of them among
the most pleasing of the many Pea flowers which adorn the hills and
mountains of the northern world in Asia, Europe, and America. They
are mostly suited for rocky or gravelly situations, or bare banks, though
some of the taller species, like A. galegiformis, are stout enough to take
care of themselves among the larger perennials. This plant is valuable
for its handsome port and foliage, though its flowering qualities are not
such as recommend it for the garden proper. The numerous species
from the Mediterranean shores and islands could be successfully introduced
on banks and slopes in our chalk districts and in rocky places.
A. ponticus, a tall kind, and A. monspessulanus, a dwarf one, are both
worth growing.</p>

<p><b>Masterwort</b>, <i>Astrantia</i>.&mdash;This is an elegant genus, of which few
species are known, five being European&mdash;found in Italy, Carinthia,
Greece, and the centre of Europe&mdash;others from Northern Asia. They
are among the few umbellates with attractive and distinct flowers, and
yet they are rarely seen in gardens. In the wild garden they are quite
at home among the Grass and medium&ndash;sized herbaceous plants, and
partial shade prolongs their quaint beauty. In fact they are far more at
home in the thin wood or copse than in the open exposed mixed border.</p>

<p><b>Blue Rock Cress</b>, <i>Aubrietia</i>.&mdash;Dwarf Alpine plants, with purplish
flowers, quite distinct in aspect and hue from anything else grown
in our gardens, and never perishing from any cause, except being overrun
by coarser subjects. They are admirable for association with the
Alyssums and Arabises in any position where the vegetation is very
dwarf, or in rocky bare places. There are several species and varieties,
all almost equally suitable, but not differing much in aspect or stature
from each other. The Aubrietias come chiefly from the mountains of
Greece, Asia Minor, and neighbouring countries. Wherever there is
an old wall, or a sunk fence, or a bare bank, evergreen curtains may
be formed of these plants, and in spring they will be sheeted with
purple flowers, no matter how harsh the weather.</p>

<p><b>Great Birthwort</b>, <i>Aristolochia Sipho</i>.&mdash;A noble plant for covering
arbours, banks, stumps of old trees, etc., also wigwam&ndash;like bowers,
formed with branches of trees. It is American, and will grow as high
as thirty feet, A. tomentosa is distinct and not so large in leaf. These
will scarcely be grown for their flowers; but for covering stumps or
trees they are valuable, and afford a distinct type of foliage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Virginian Creepers</b>, <i>Ampelopsis</i>.&mdash;Although this chapter is
mostly devoted to herbaceous plants, the Virginian Creeper and its
allies are so useful for forming curtains in rocky places, ravines, or over
old trees, that they deserve mention here. These plants are not very
distant relations of the vine&mdash;the wild American vines which are
worthy of a place in our groves, garlanding trees as they do in a grand
way. Some noble in colour of leaf are grown in nurseries&mdash;U. Humboldti
being remarkable both for colour and size of leaf.</p>

<p><b>Bamboo</b>, <i>Bambusa</i>.&mdash;In many parts of England, Ireland, and
Wales, various kinds of Bamboos are perfectly hardy, and not only
hardy, but thrive freely. In cold, dry, and inland districts, it is true,
they grow with difficulty&mdash;all the greater reason for making the best
use of them where they grow freely. Their beauty is the more
precious from their being wholly distinct in habit from any other
plants or shrubs that we grow. The delicate feathering of the young,
tall, and slender shoots, the charming arching of the stems, have often
been fertile in suggestion to the Japanese artist, and often adorn his
best work. They may be enjoyed with all the charms of life in many
gardens. The wild garden, where the climate is suitable, is the best
home for Bamboos. They are so tall and so enduring at the roots that
they will take care of themselves among the tallest and strongest plants
or bushes, and the partial shelter of the thin wood or copse preserves
their abundant leaves from violent and cold winds. Along by quiet
Grass walks, in sheltered dells, in little bogs, in the shrubbery, or in
little lawns opened in woods for the formation of wild gardens, the
Bamboo will be at home. The commonest kind is that generally
known as Arundinaria falcata (sometimes called Bambusa gracilis);
but others, such as Bambusa Metake, B. Simmonsi, and B. viridis&ndash;glaucescens,
are of equal or greater value. They all delight in rich,
light, and moist soils.</p>

<p><b>Baptisia.</b>&mdash;A strong Lupin&ndash;like plant seldom grown in gardens,
but beautiful when in bloom for its long blue racemes of pea flowers,
growing three to four feet high; it will hold its own in strong soil.</p>

<p><b>Borage</b>, <i>Borago</i>.&mdash;A genus seldom seen out of Botanic gardens,
where they form part of the usual distressing arrangements honoured
with the name of “scientific.” Among the best kinds for our purpose
are B. cretica and B. orientalis, even the well&ndash;known annual kind
will be found a pretty plant, naturalised and useful for covering
mounds.</p>

<p><b>Bell&ndash;flower</b>, <i>Campanula</i>.&mdash;Beautiful and generally blue&ndash;flowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
herbs, varying from a few inches to 4 ft. in height, and abundantly
scattered in northern and temperate countries. Many kinds are in
cultivation. All the medium&ndash;sized and large kinds thrive very well in
rough places, woods, copses, or shrubberies, among grasses and other
herbaceous plants; while those smaller in size than our own harebell
(C. rotundifolia) are quite at home, and very pretty, on any arid or
bare surfaces, such as sandy banks, chalk pits, and even high up on
old walls, ruins, etc. In such positions the seeds have only to be
scattered. C. rapunculoides and C. lamiifolia do finely in shrubberies
or copses, as, indeed, do all the tall&ndash;growing kinds. Where there are
white varieties they should be secured; many people will begin to see
the great beauty of this family for the first time when they see them
growing among the grass or herbs. The effect is far more beautiful
than can be obtained in the garden proper.</p>

<p><b>Red Valerian</b>, <i>Centranthus ruber</i>.&mdash;This showy and pleasing
plant is only seen in highest perfection on elevated banks, rubbish&ndash;heaps,
or old walls, in which positions it endures much longer than on
the level ground, and becomes a long&ndash;lived perennial with a shrubby
base. On the long bridge across the Nore at Col. Tighe’s place, Woodstock,
Kilkenny, it grows in abundance, forming a long line on the
wall above the arches; of course it could be easily grown on ruins,
while it is invaluable for banks of all kinds, chalk pits, etc., and
also for the level ground, except in heavy cold soils. Some of the
larger Valerianas would grow freely in rough places, but none of them
are so distinct as the preceding.</p>

<p><b>Knap&ndash;weed</b>, <i>Centaurea</i>.&mdash;Vigorous perennial or annual herbaceous
plants, seldom so pretty as autumn&ndash;sown plants of our corn bluebottle
(C. Cyanus). They are scarcely important enough for borders; hence
the wild wood is the place for them. Among the most suitable kinds
may be mentioned macrocephala, montana, babylonica, and uniflora,
the last more suitable for banks, etc.</p>

<p><b>Mouse&ndash;ear</b>, <i>Cerastium</i>.&mdash;Dwarf spreading perennials, bearing a
profusion of white flowers. Half a dozen or more of the kinds have
silvery leaves, which, with their flowers, give them an attractive
character. Most of these are used as bedding plants, but, as they will
grow in any position where they are not choked by coarser plants,
they may be employed with good effect in the wild garden.</p>

<p><b>Wallflower</b>, <i>Cheiranthus</i>.&mdash;The varieties of the common wallflower
afford quite a store of beauty in themselves for the embellishment
of rocky places, old walls, etc. Probably other species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Cheiranthus will be found to grow on ruins quite as well, but at
present we are not quite sure of these. The clear yellow Erysimum
ochroleucum is very like a wallflower in type, and thrives well in dry
sandy places. With these might be associated Vesicaria utriculata.<span class="vh"><a name="ill132" id="ill132">ill132</a></span></p></div>

<div class="pbq">

<p><b>Meadow Saffron</b>, <i>Colchicum</i>.&mdash;In addition to the meadow
saffron, plentifully dotted over the moist fields in various parts of
England, there are several other species which could be readily
naturalised in almost any soil and position. They would be particularly
desirable where
subjects that flower
in autumn would
be sought; and
they are charming,
seen in tufts or
colonies on the
lawn or in the
pleasure&ndash;ground.</p>

<p><b>Crocus.</b>&mdash;One
or two Crocuses are
naturalised in England
already, and
there is scarcely one
of them that will not
succeed thus if properly
placed. They should not be placed where coarse vegetation would
choke them up or prevent the sun getting to their flowers and leaves.
Some of the delicately&ndash;tinted varieties of vernus are well worth dotting
about in grassy places and on sunny slopes, if only to accompany the snowdrop.
C. Imperati is a valuable early&ndash;flowering kind, and the autumnal
flowering ones are particularly desirable; but we must not particularise
where all are good. “In the plantations here,” writes a correspondent,
“on each side of a long avenue, we have the common Crocus in every
shade of purple (there are scarcely any yellow ones) growing literally
in hundreds of thousands. We have no record of when the roots were
originally planted (and the oldest people about the estate say they have
always been the same as far as their recollection goes); but they grow
so thickly that it is quite impossible to step where they are without
treading on two or three flowers. The effect produced by them in spring
is magnificent, but unfortunately, their beauty is but short&ndash;lived. I
have transplanted a good many roots to the wild garden, to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
improvement of the size of the individual blooms; they are so matted
together in the shrubberies I have mentioned, and have remained so
long in the same place, that the flowers are small.”<span class="vh"><a name="ill133" id="ill133">ill133</a></span></p></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Virgin’s Bower</b>, <i>Clematis</i>.&mdash;Mostly climbing or trailing plants,
free, often luxuriant, sometimes rampant, in habit, with bluish, violet,
purple, white, or yellow flowers, produced most profusely, and sometimes
deliciously fragrant. They are most suited for covering stumps,
planting on rocky places, among low shrubs in copses, for draping over
the faces of rocks, sunny banks, or the brows of sunk fences, covering
objectionable railings,
rough bowers, chalk
pits, hedges, etc., and
occasionally for isolating
in large tufts in
open spaces where
their effect could be
seen from a distance.
Not particular as to
soil, the stronger kinds
will grow in any
ground, but the large&ndash;flowered new hybrids will thrive best in warm,
rich, deep soil.</p>

<p>C. Viorna, C. flammula, montana, campaniflora, Viticella, and
cirrhosa, must not be omitted from a selection of the wild kinds. The
new garden hybrids will also be useful.</p>

<p><b>Dwarf Cornel</b>, <i>Cornus canadensis</i>.&mdash;This charming little bushy
plant, singularly beautiful from its white bracts, is a very attractive
subject for naturalisation in moist, sandy, or peaty spots, in which our
native heaths, Mitchella repens, Linnæa borealis, and the Butterworts
would be likely to thrive. It would also grow well in moist woods,
where the herbaceous vegetation is dwarf.</p>

<p><b>Mocassin Flower</b>, <i>Cypripedium spectabile</i>.&mdash;The noblest of hardy
orchids, found far north in America, and thriving perfectly in England
and Ireland in deep rich or vegetable soil. Wherever the soil is not
naturally peat or rich vegetable matter this fine plant will succeed on
the margins of beds of rhododendrons, etc. It should be sheltered by
surrounding bushes, and be in a moist position. Others of the genus,
and various other hardy orchids, are worthy of naturalisation; but the
mocassin flower is the best as well as the most easily tried at present.</p>

<p><b>Sowbread</b>, <i>Cyclamen</i>.&mdash;It was the sight of a grove nearly covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
with Cyclamen hederæfolium, near Montargis, in France, that first
turned my attention to the “Wild Garden.” Both C. hederæfolium
and C. europæum may be naturalised with the greatest ease on light,
loamy, or other warm and open soil. C. vernum, C. Coum, and C.
repandum, are also well worthy of trial. Nothing can be more agreeable
to the lover of hardy plants than endeavouring to naturalise these
charming flowers, now rarely seen out of the greenhouse. The best
positions would be among dwarf shrubs, etc., that would afford slight
shelter, on banks or sunny open spots in copses or woods. Bare or
dug borders they abhor, and a sunny warm exposure should be chosen.
In the case of C. hederæfolium (and perhaps some of the others) ground
under trees, bare, or with a very scant vegetation of herbs, etc., would
do quite well if the soil were free and warm. There is scarcely a
country seat in England in which the hardy Cyclamens, now almost
entirely neglected by the gardener, could not be naturalised.</p></div>

<p><b>The Giant Sea&ndash;kale</b>, <i>Crambe</i>.&mdash;“C. cordifolia is a very fine
perennial, but its place is on the turf in rich soil. It has enormous
leaves, and small whitish flowers in panicles. Here it is one of the
finest ornaments in a wild garden of about five acres, associated with
Rheums, Ferulas, Gunneras, Centaurea babylonica, Arundo Donax,
Acanthus, and others.”</p>

<p><b>Bindweed</b>, <i>Calystegia</i>.&mdash;Climbing plants, with handsome white
or rosy flowers, often too vigorous in constitution to be agreeable in
gardens, as is the case with our common bindweed. C. dahurica, somewhat
larger than the common kind, is very handsome when allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to trail through shrubs, in rough places, or over stumps, rustic
bridges, etc., and doubtless sundry other species will in time be found
equally useful.</p>

<p>The pretty little Rosy Bindweed that one meets often upon the
shores of the Mediterranean is here depicted at home in an English
garden, creeping up the leaves of an Iris in Mr. Wilson’s garden at
Heatherbank, Weybridge Heath. It is a great privilege we have of
being able to grow the fair flowers of so many regions in our own, and
without caring for them in the sense, and with the
troubles that attend other living creatures in menageries,
aviaries, etc. This is an advantage that we do not evidently
consider when we put a few
plants in lines and circles only, oblivious
of the infinite beauty and variety
of the rest. This beautiful pink Bindweed
is the representative, so to speak,
of our own Rosy Field Bindweed in the
south, but nevertheless it is perfectly
hardy and free in our own soils. Its
botanical name is Convolvulus althæoides.<span class="vh"><a name="ill135" id="ill135">ill135</a></span></p></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Marsh Calla</b>, <i>Calla palustris</i>.&mdash;A
creeping Arum&ndash;like plant, with white
flowers showing above a carpet of glossy
leaves, admirable for naturalisation in
muddy places, moist bogs, on the margins
of ponds, etc.</p>

<p><b>Rosy Coronilla</b>, <i>Coronilla varia</i>.&mdash;Europe.
On grassy banks, stony heaps,
rough rocky ground, spreading over
slopes or any like positions. A very
fine plant for naturalisation, thriving
in any soil.</p>

<p><b>Giant Scabious</b>, <i>Cephalaria</i>.&mdash;Allied to Scabious but seldom
grown. They are worth a place in the wild garden for their fine
vigour alone, and the numerous pale yellow flowers will be admired by
those who do not limit their admiration to showy colours.</p>

<p><b>Coral&ndash;wort</b>, <i>Dentaria</i>.&mdash;Very showy perennials, the purplish or
white flowers of which present somewhat of the appearance of a stockflower,
quite distinct both in habit and bloom, and very rarely seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in our gardens; they will be found to thrive well and look well in
peat soil beneath rhododendrons, and towards the margins of clumps
of American shrubs.</p>

<p><b>Leopard’s Bane</b>, <i>Doronicum</i>.&mdash;Stout, medium&ndash;sized, or dwarf
perennials, with hardy and vigorous constitutions, and very showy
flowers; well suited for naturalisation among herbaceous vegetation, in
any position where the beauty of their early bloom can be enjoyed.</p>

<p><b>American Cowslip</b>, <i>Dodecatheon</i>.&mdash;All who care for hardy
flowers admire the beautiful American cowslip (D. Meadia), found in rich
woods in Pennsylvania, Ohio, to Wisconsin and south&ndash;westward, in
America. This would be a charming plant to naturalise on rich and
light sandy loams, among dwarf herbs, low shrubs, etc., in sheltered
and sunny spots. Jeffrey’s American cowslip (D. Jeffreyanum), a
vigorous&ndash;growing kind, is also well worth a trial in this way, though
as yet it is hardly plentiful enough to be spared for this purpose.</p>

<p><b>Fumitory</b>, <i>Fumaria</i>, <i>Dielytra</i>.&mdash;Plants with graceful leaves and
gay flowers suited for association with dwarf subjects on open banks,
except D. spectabilis, which in deep peat or other rich soil will grow a
yard high. The simple&ndash;looking little Fumaria bulbosa is one of the
dwarf subjects which thrive very well under the branches of specimen
deciduous trees, and Corydalis lutea thrives in every position from the
top of an old castle to the bottom of a well shaft. I saw Dielytra eximia
naturalised in Buckhurst Park, in a shrubbery, the position shady. Its
effect was most charming, the plumy tufts being dotted all over with
flowers. Had I before wished to naturalise this, I should have put it
on open slopes, or among dwarf plants, but it thrives and spreads
about with the greatest freedom in shady spots. The blossoms, instead
of being of the usual crimson hue, were of a peculiar delicate pale rose,
no doubt owing to the shade; and, as they gracefully drooped over the
elegantly&ndash;cut leaves, they looked like snowdrops of a faint rosy hue.</p>

<p><b>Delphinium</b>, <i>Perennial species</i>.&mdash;Tall and beautiful herbaceous
plants, with flowers of many exquisite shades of blue and purple.
There are now numerous varieties. They are well suited for rich soil
in glades, copses, thin shrubberies, or among masses of dwarf shrubs,
above which their fine spikes of bloom might here and there arise.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest effects which I have ever seen among naturalised
plants was a colony of tall Larkspurs (Delphiniums). Portions
of old roots of several species and varieties had been chopped off
where a bed of these plants was being dug in the autumn. For
convenience sake the refuse had been thrown into the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
shrubbery, far in among the shrubs and tall trees. Here they grew in
certain half&ndash;open little spaces, which were so far removed from the
margin that they were not dug and were not seen. When I saw the
Larkspurs in flower they were certainly the loveliest things that one
could see. They were more beautiful than they are in borders or beds,
not growing in such close stiff tufts, and mingling with and relieved
by the trees above and the shrubs around. Little more need be said
to any one who knows and cares about such plants, and has an opportunity
of planting in such neglected places. This case points out
pretty clearly that one might make wild gardens from the mere parings
and thinnings of the beds and borders in autumn, in any place where
there is a collection of good hardy plants. The cut on p. 28 does
scant justice to the scene, which, perhaps, it is not in the power of
wood engraving to illustrate.</p>

<p><b>Pink</b>, <i>Dianthus</i>.&mdash;A numerous race of beautiful dwarf mountain
plants, with flowers mostly of various shades of rose, sometimes sporting
into other colours in cultivation. The finer mountain kinds would
be likely to thrive only on bare stony or rocky ground, and amidst
very dwarf vegetation. The bright D. neglectus would thrive in any
ordinary soil. Some of the kinds in the way of our own D. cæsius
grow well on old walls and ruins, as do the single carnations and
pinks; indeed, it is probable that many kinds of pink would thrive
on ruins and old walls better far than on the ground.</p>

<p><b>Foxglove</b>, <i>Digitalis</i>.&mdash;It need not be said here that our own
stately Foxglove should be encouraged in the wild garden, particularly
in districts where it does not naturally grow wild; I allude to it here
to point out that there are a number of exotic species for which a
place might be found in the wild garden&mdash;some of them are not very
satisfactory otherwise. The most showy hardy flowers of midsummer
are the Foxglove and the French willow (Epilobium angustifolium),
and in wild or rough places in shrubberies, etc., their effect is beautiful.
In such half shady places the Foxglove thrives best; and, as the French
willow is much too rampant a plant for the garden proper, the proper
place for it too is in the wild garden. It is a most showy plant, and
masses of it may be seen great distances off. The delicately and
curiously spotted varieties of the Foxglove should be sown as well
as the ordinary wild form.</p>

<p><b>Hemp Agrimony</b>, <i>Eupatorium</i>.&mdash;Vigorous perennials, with
white or purple fringed flowers. Some of the American kinds might
well be associated with our own wild one&mdash;the white kinds, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
aromaticum and ageratoides, being very beautiful and distinct, and well
worthy of a place in the best parts of the wild garden.</p>

<p><b>Sea Holly</b>, <i>Eryngium</i>.&mdash;Very distinct and noble&ndash;looking perennials,
with ornamental and usually spiny leaves, and flowers in
heads, sometimes surrounded by a bluish involucrum, and supported
on stems of a fine amethystine blue. They would be very attractive
on margins of shrubberies and near wood&ndash;walks, thrive in ordinary
free soil, and will take care of themselves among tall grasses and all
but the most vigorous herbs.</p>

<p><b>Heath</b>, <i>Erica</i>, <i>Menziesia</i>.&mdash;Our own heathy places are pretty rich
in this type, but the brilliant Erica carnea is so distinct and attractive
that it well deserves naturalisation among
them. The beautiful St. Daboec’s heath
(Menziesia polifolia) deserves a trial in
the same way, as, though found in the
west of Ireland, it is to the majority of
English gardens an exotic plant. It will
grow almost anywhere in peaty soil.</p>

<p><b>Barren&ndash;wort</b>, <i>Epimedium</i>.&mdash;Interesting
and very distinct, but comparatively
little known perennials, with pretty
and usually delicately tinted flowers, and
singular and ornamental foliage. They
are most suitable for peaty or free moist
soils, in sheltered positions, among low
shrubs on rocky banks, etc., and near the
eye. The variety called E. pinnatum
elegans, when in deep peat soil, forms tufts of leaves nearly a yard
high, and in spring is adorned with long racemes of pleasing yellow
flowers, so that it is well worthy of naturalisation where the soil is
suitable.<span class="vh"><a name="ill138" id="ill138">ill138</a></span></p></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Globe Thistle</b>, <i>Echinops</i>.&mdash;Large and distinct perennials of fine
port, from 3 feet to 6 feet high, with spiny leaves and numerous
flowers in spherical heads. These will thrive well in almost any
position, and hold their ground amid the coarsest vegetation. Being
of a “type” quite distinct from that of our indigenous vegetation, they
are more than usually suited for naturalisation. Echinops exaltatus
and E. ruthenicus, are among the best kinds, the last the best in colour.</p>

<p><b>May&ndash;flower</b>, <i>Epigæa repens</i>.&mdash;A small creeping shrub, with pretty
and deliciously fragrant flowers, which appear soon after the melting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of the snow in N. America, and are there as welcome as the hawthorn
with us. In its native country it inhabits woods, mostly in the shade
of pines; and usually, wherever I saw it, it seemed to form a carpet
under three or four layers of vegetation, so to speak&mdash;that is to say,
it was beneath pines, medium&ndash;sized trees, tall bushes, and dwarf scrub
about 18 in. high, while the plant itself was not more than one or
two inches high. In our gardens this plant is very rarely seen, and
even in the great American plant nurseries, where it used to grow it
has disappeared. This is no wonder, when it is considered how very
different are the conditions which it enjoys in gardens compared with
those which I have above described. Without doubt it can be naturalised
easily in pine woods on a sandy soil.</p>

<p><b>Dog’s&ndash;tooth Violet</b>, <i>Erythronium</i>.&mdash;A few days ago I saw a
number of irregular clumps of these here and there on a gently sloping
bank of turf, and, in front of clumps of evergreens, they looked
quite charming, and their dark spotted leaves showed up to much
better effect on the fresh green Grass than they do in borders. They
were all of the red variety, and required a few of the white form
among them to make the picture perfect.</p>

<p>So writes a correspondent in Ireland. This beautiful plant, some
years ago rarely seen in our gardens, adorns many a dreary slope in the
Southern Alps, and there should be no great difficulty in the way
of adding its charms to the wild garden in peaty or sandy spots,
rather bare or under deciduous vegetation.</p>

<p><b>The Winter Aconite</b>, <i>Eranthis hyemalis</i>.&mdash;Classed among British
plants but really naturalised. Its golden buttons peeping through the
moss and grass in snowdrop time form one of the prettiest aspects of
our garden vegetation in spring. It will grow anywhere, and is one
of the plants that thrive under the spreading branches of summer&ndash;leafing
trees, as it blooms and perfects its leaves before the buds open
on the beech. On many lawns, spring gardens might be formed by
planting some spring flowering plants that finish their growth
before the trees are in leaf. Another advantage of such positions
is, that the foliage of the tree prevents any coarser plants taking
possession of the ground, and therefore these little spring plants
have the ground to themselves, and wander into natural little groups
in the moss and grass, sometimes covering the surface with a sheet of
blossoms.</p>

<p><b>Funkia.</b>&mdash;I have spoken of the conditions in the wild garden
being more suitable to many plants than those which obtain in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
might seem choice positions in borders, many of the plants attaining
greater beauty and remaining longer in bloom in the shade and
shelter of shrubby places than when fully exposed. As an instance
of this, I saw Funkia c&oelig;rulea the other day, showing a size and beauty
in a shady drive at Beauport, near Battle, which I never saw it attain
under other circumstances. The plant was over a yard high, and bore
many stately stems hung with blue flowers. The Funkias are exceedingly
valuable plants for the wild garden, not being liable to accidents
which are fatal to Lilies and other plants exposed to the attacks of
slugs and rabbits.</p></div>

<p><b>Snakes&ndash;head</b>, <i>Fritillaria</i>.&mdash;The beautiful British snakes&ndash;head
(F. Meleagris) grows wild, as most people know, in meadows in various
parts of England, and we should like to see it as well established in
the grassy hollows of many a country seat. Various other Fritillarias
not so pretty as this, and of a peculiar livid dark hue, which is not
like to make them popular in gardens, such as F. tristis, would be
worthy of a position also; while the Crown Imperial would do on the
fringes of shrubberies.</p>

<p><b>Giant Fennel</b>, <i>Ferula</i>.&mdash;Noble herbaceous plants belonging to
the parsley order, with much and exquisitely divided leaves; when
well developed forming magnificent tufts of verdure, reminding one
of the most finely&ndash;cut ferns, but far larger. The leaves appear very
early in spring, and disappear at the end of summer, and the best use
that can be made of the plants is to plant them here and there in
places occupied by spring and early summer flowers, among which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
they would produce a very fine effect. With the Ferulas might be
grouped another handsome umbelliferous plant (Molopospermum cicutarium);
and no doubt, when we know the ornamental qualities of the
order better, we shall find sundry other charming plants of similar
character.</p>

<p><b>Ferns.</b>&mdash;No plants may be naturalised more successfully and with
a more charming effect than ferns. The royal ferns, of which the
bold foliage is reflected in the marsh waters of Northern America, will
do well in the many places where our own royal fern thrives. The
graceful maidenhair fern of the rich woods of the Eastern States and
the Canadas will thrive perfectly in any cool, shady, narrow lane,
or dyke, or in a shady wood. The small ferns that find a home on arid
alpine cliffs may be established on old walls and ruins. Cheilanthes
odora, which grows so freely on the sunny sides of walls in Southern
France, would be well worth trying in similar positions in the south
of England, the spores to be sown in mossy chinks of the walls. The
climbing fern Lygodium palmatum, which goes as far north as cold
Massachusetts, would twine its graceful stems up the undershrubs in
an English wood too. In fact, there is no fern of the numbers that
inhabit the northern regions of Europe, Asia, and America, that may
not be tried with confidence in various positions, preferring for the
greater number such positions as we know our native kinds to thrive
best in. One could form a rich and stately type of wood&ndash;haunting
fern vegetation without employing one of our native kinds at all,
though, of course, generally the best way will be to associate all so
far as their habits and sizes will permit. Treat them boldly; put
strong kinds out in glades; imagine colonies of Daffodils among the
Oak and Beech Ferns, fringed by early Aconite, in the spots overshadowed
by the branches of deciduous trees. Then, again, many of
these Ferns, the more delicate of them, could be used as the most
graceful of carpets for bold beds or groups of flowering plants. They
would form part, and a very
important part, of what we
have written of as evergreen
herbaceous plants, and
might well be associated
with them in true winter
gardens.<span class="vh"><a name="ill141" id="ill141">ill141</a></span></p></div>

rather dwarf perennials, mostly with bluish, pinkish, or deep rose flowers,
admirable for naturalisation. Some of the better kinds of the hardy
geraniums, such as G. ibericum, are the very plants to take care of
themselves on wild banks and similar places. With them might be
associated the fine Erodium Manescavi; and where there are very
bare places, on which they would not be overrun by coarser plants, the
smaller Erodiums, such as E. romanum, might be tried with advantage.</p>

<p><b>Goat’s Rue</b>, <i>Galega</i>.&mdash;Tall and vigorous but graceful perennials,
with very numerous
and handsome flowers,
pink, blue, or white.
G. officinalis and its
white variety are among
the very best of all tall
border flowers, and
they are equally useful
for planting in rough
and wild places, as is
also the blue G. orientalis
and G. biloba.
They are all free
growers.<span class="vh"><a name="ill142" id="ill142">ill142</a></span></p></div>

<div class="pbq">

<p><b>Gypsophila</b>, <i>Gypsophila
and Tunica</i>.&mdash;Vigorous
but neat perennials,
very hardy,
and producing myriads
of flowers, mostly
small, and of a pale
pinkish hue. They are
best suited for rocky
or sandy ground, or
even old ruins, or any
position where they will not be smothered by coarser vegetation.
Similar in character is the pretty little Tunica saxifraga, which grows
on the tops of old walls, etc., in Southern Europe, and will thrive on
bare places on the level ground with us.</p>

<p><b>Gentian</b>, <i>Gentiana</i>.&mdash;Dwarf, and usually evergreen, alpine or high&ndash;pasture
plants, with large and numerous flowers, mostly handsome, and
frequently of the most vivid and beautiful blue. The large G. acaulis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
(Gentianella) would grow as freely in moist places on any of our own
mountains as it does on its native hills; as, indeed, it would in all
moist loams, where it could not be choked by coarse and taller subjects.
The tall willow Gentian (G. asclepiadea) is a handsome plant, which, in
the mountain woods of Switzerland, may be seen blooming among long
grass in shade of trees, and this fact is suggestive as to its use in this
country.</p>

<p><b>Snowdrops</b>, <i>Galanthus</i>.&mdash;The charms of our own Snowdrop
when naturalised in the grass are well known to all, but many of the
new kinds have claims also in that respect, such as Elwesi and G.
plicatus. It is surprising how comparatively few people take
advantage of the facility with which the Snowdrop grows in grass, so
as to have it in pretty groups and colonies by grass&ndash;walks or drives.
The accompanying illustration, which shows it on the margin of a
streamlet in a Somersetshire valley, shows that it is not particular as to
situation. It suggests the many places it may adorn other than the
garden border.</p>

<p><b>Cow Parsnips</b>, <i>Heracleum</i>.&mdash;Giant herbaceous plants, mostly
from Northern Asia, with huge divided leaves, and umbels (sometimes
a foot across) of white or whitish flowers. They are very suitable for
rough places on the banks of rivers or artificial water, islands, or in
any position in which a very vigorous and bold type of foliage may be
desired. In arranging them it should be borne in mind that their
foliage dies down and disappears in the end of summer. When
established they sow themselves, so that seedling plants in abundance
may be picked up around them. In all cases it is important that their
seed should be sown immediately after being gathered. But it is also
important not to allow them to monopolise the ground, as then they
become objectionable. To this end it may, in certain positions, be
desirable to prevent them seeding.</p>

<p><b>Day Lily</b>, <i>Hemerocallis</i>.&mdash;Vigorous plants of the lily order, with
long leaves and graceful habit, and large and showy red&ndash;orange or
yellow flowers, sometimes scented as delicately as the primrose. There
are two types, one large and strong like flava and fulva, the other short
and somewhat fragile like graminea. The larger kinds are superb
plants for naturalisation, growing in any soil, and taking care of themselves
among coarse herbaceous plants or brambles.</p>

<p><b>Christmas Rose</b>, <i>Helleborus</i>.&mdash;Stout but dwarf perennials, with
showy blooms appearing in winter and spring when flowers are rare,
and with handsome leathery and glossy leaves. They thrive in almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
any position or soil; but to get the full benefit of their early&ndash;blooming
tendency it is desirable to place them on sunny grassy banks in tufts
or groups, and not far from the eye, as they are usually of unobtrusive
colours. They form beautiful ornaments near wild wood walks,
where the spring sun can reach them. There are various kinds useful
for naturalisation.<span class="vh"><a name="ill144" id="ill144">ill144</a></span></p></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Sun Rose</b>, <i>Helianthemum</i>.&mdash;Dwarf spreading shrubs, bearing
myriads of flowers in a variety
of showy colours. The most
tasteful and satisfactory way of
employing these in our gardens
is to naturalise them on banks
or slopes in the half&ndash;wild parts
of our pleasure&ndash;grounds, mostly
in sandy or warm soil. They
are best suited for chalk districts
or rocky ones, where they thrive
most luxuriantly, and make a
very brilliant display. There
are many varieties, mostly differing
in the hue of the flowers.</p>

<p><b>Perennial Sunflower</b>,
<i>Helianthus</i>, <i>Rudbeckia</i>, <i>Silphium</i>.&mdash;Stout
and usually very tall
perennials, with showy yellow
flowers, the best known of which
is Helianthus multiflorus fl. pl.,
of which plenty may be seen in
Euston Square and other places
in London. As a rule these
are all better fitted for rough
places than for gardens, where,
like many other plants mentioned in these pages, they will tend to
form a vigorous herbaceous covert. H. rigidus is a brilliantly showy
plant, running very freely at the root, and an excellent subject for
naturalisation. H. giganteus, common in thickets and swamps in
America, and growing as high as 10 ft., is also desirable. The showy
and larger American Rudbeckias, such as laciniata, triloba, and also
the small but showy hirta, virtually belong to the same type. All
these plants, and many others of the tall yellow&ndash;flowered composites that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
one sees conspicuous among herbaceous vegetation in America, would
produce very showy effects in autumn, and might perhaps more
particularly interest those who only visit their country seats at that
time of year. The Silphiums, especially the compass plant (S.
laciniatum), and the cup plant (S. perfoliatum), are allied in general
aspect and character to the Helianthuses, and are suitable for the same
purposes.</p>

<p><b>St. John’s Wort</b>, <i>Hypericum</i>.&mdash;The well&ndash;known St. John’s wort
has already in many places made good its claim as a wilderness plant,
and there is scarcely one of its numerous congeners which will not
thrive in wild and rough places, in any soil. They have all the same
bright yellow flowers as the St. John’s wort, and are nearly all taller.
Some of the newer kinds have the handsome large flowers of the St.
John’s Wort. It should be noted that the common St. John’s Wort so
exhausts the soil of moisture that it may be the cause of the death of
trees, and should therefore be looked after. Many places have too
much of it, as they have of the common Laurel.</p>

<p><b>Rocket</b>, <i>Hesperis</i>.&mdash;The common single Rocket (Hesperis matronalis)
is a showy useful plant in copse or shrubbery, and very easily
raised from seed.</p>

<p><b>Evergreen Candytuft</b>, <i>Iberis</i>.&mdash;Compact little evergreens, forming
spreading bushes from 3 inches to 15 inches high, and sheeted with
white flowers in spring and early summer. There are no plants more
suitable for naturalisation in open or bare places, or, indeed, in any
position where the vegetation is not strong enough to overrun them.
They, however, attain greatest perfection when fully exposed to the
sun, and are admirable for every kind of rocky or stony ground and
banks.</p>

<p><b>Iris</b>, <i>Fleur de Lis</i>.&mdash;These plants, once so well known in our gardens,
rivalling (or rather exceeding) the lilies in beauty, are varied and
numerous enough to make a wild garden by themselves. The many
beautiful varieties of germanica will grow in almost any soil, and may
be used with good effect in woods, copses, by wood walks, or near the
margin of water. I. sibirica, rather a common kind, will grow in the
water; and, as this is not generally known, it is worthy the notice of
any one taking an interest in aquatics. It is probable that others of
the beardless kinds will also do well with their roots below the water,
and if so, they will one day much improve the rather poorly adorned
margins of artificial waters. On the other hand, I. pumila, and the
varieties of germanica, are often seen on the tops of old walls, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
thatched roofs, etc., on the Continent, flowering profusely. These facts
tend to show how many different positions may be adorned by the irises.<span class="vh"><a name="ill146" id="ill146">ill146</a></span></p></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Common Lupine</b>, <i>Lupinus polyphyllus</i>.&mdash;Amidst the tallest and
handsomest herbaceous plants, grouped
where they may be seen from grass
drives or wood walks, or in any
position or soil. Excellent for islets
or river banks, in which, or in
copses, it spreads freely. There are
several varieties, all worthy of culture.</p>

<p><b>Honesty</b>, <i>Lunaria</i>.&mdash;This,
which approaches the Stocks in the
aspect of its fine purplish violet
flowers, is quite removed from them
by the appearance of its curious
seed&ndash;vessels. It is one of the most
valuable of all plants for naturalisation,
and may be said to form a
type by itself. It shows itself freely
in dryish ground or on chalk banks,
and is one of the prettiest objects
to be met with in early summer
in wood or wild.</p>

<p><b>Lily</b>, <i>Lilium</i>.&mdash;There are many
hardy lilies that may be naturalised.
The situations that these grow in,
from the high meadows of Northern
Italy, dotted with the orange lily,
to the woody gorges of the Sierras
in California, rich with tall and
fragrant kinds, are such as make
their culture in copses, woods, rough
grassy places, etc., a certainty. In
woods where there is a rich deposit
of vegetable matter the great
American Lilium superbum, and
no doubt some of the recently&ndash;discovered
Californian lilies, will do well. The European lilies,
dotted in the grass in the rough unmown glades, would not grow
nearly so large as they do in the rich borders of our cottage gardens;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
but the effect of the single large blooms of the orange lily just level
with the tops of the grass, in early summer, where it grows wild, is at
least as beautiful as any aspect it has hitherto presented in gardens.
Along the bed of small rivulets, in the bottom of narrow gorges densely
shaded by great Thujas, Arbutus trees sixty and even eighty feet high,
and handsome large&ndash;leaved evergreen oaks on the Sierras, I saw in
autumn numbers of lily stems seven, eight, and nine feet high, so one
could imagine what pictures they formed in early summer; therefore
deep dykes and narrow shady lanes would afford congenial homes for
various fine species. No mode of cultivating lilies in gardens is equal
to that of dotting them through beds of rhododendrons and other
American plants usually planted in peat; the soil of these, usually
and very unwisely left to the rhododendrons alone, being peculiarly
suited to the majority of the lily tribe. As for the wild garden, Mr.
G. F. Wilson sent me a stem of Lilium superbum last year (1880)
grown in a rich woody bottom, 11½ feet high!</p>

<p><b>Snowflake</b>, <i>Leucojum</i>.&mdash;I have rarely seen anything more beautiful
than a colony of the summer Snowflake on the margin of a tuft of
rhododendrons in the gardens at Longleat. Some of the flowers were
on stems nearly 3 feet high, the partial shelter of the bushes and good
soil causing the plants to be unusually vigorous. Both the spring and
summer Snowflakes (L. vernum and L. æstivum) are valuable plants for
wild grassy places.</p>

<p><b>Gentian Lithosperm</b>, <i>Lithospermum prostratum</i>.&mdash;A very distinct,
prostrate, hairy, half&ndash;shrubby plant, with a profusion of flowers
of as fine a blue as any gentian. Thrives vigorously in any deep sandy
soil, and in such well deserves naturalisation among low rock plants,
etc., in sunny positions. Probably other species of the genus will be
found suitable for the same purpose.</p>

<p><b>Lychnis.</b>&mdash;Handsome medium&ndash;sized perennials, with showy
blooms, mostly of a brilliant rose or scarlet colour. If the type
was only represented by the rose campion it would be a valuable
one. This is a beautiful object in dry soils, on which it does not
perish in winter. They are most fitted for association with dwarf or
medium&ndash;sized perennials, in open places and in rich soil.</p>

<p><b>Honeysuckle</b>, <i>Lonicera</i>.&mdash;Such favourites as these must not be
omitted. Any kind of climbing Honeysuckle will find a happy home
in the wild garden, either rambling over stumps or hedgerows, or
even planted by themselves on banks.</p>

<p><b>Pea</b>, <i>Lathyrus</i>.&mdash;Much having been lately written concerning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
wild garden and its suitable occupants, I venture to suggest Lathyrus
pyrenaicus as an addition to the list. Most cultivators of flowers are
aware of the rambling habits of the greater number of plants of the
Leguminous tribe, but in that particular L. pyrenaicus eclipses them
all. It produces an immense quantity of bright orange&ndash;coloured
blossoms, but the principal difficulty connected with its thorough
development is the selection of an appropriate place for it, for a well&ndash;established
plant of this species
will ramble over, and by its
density of growth prevent every
plant and shrub that comes
within its reach from thriving;
indeed, it is a greater rambler
than the Hop, the Bindweed,
or the Bryony, and is decidedly
more handsome. Tying up or
training such a plant is out of
the question; but there are
many rough places in the wild
garden where it would be quite
at home and form an attractive
feature. Every kind of
Everlasting Pea is excellent
for the wild garden, either for
scrambling over hedgerows,
stumps, or growing among
the grass.&mdash;J. W.<span class="vh"><a name="ill148" id="ill148">ill148</a></span></p></div>

<p><b>Monkey&ndash;flower</b>, <i>Mimulus</i>.&mdash;“Wandering
one day in
the neighbourhood of “Gruigfoot,” a queer&ndash;shaped hill in Linlithgowshire,
my eye was attracted by a small burn whose banks were literally jewelled
throughout its visible course with an unfamiliar yellow flower. A
nearer approach showed me that it was the garden Mimulus (Monkey&ndash;flower),
the seed of which must have escaped from some neighbouring
cottage garden, and established itself here, in the coldest part of the
British Isles. I took the hint, and have naturalised it by the banks
of a small stream which runs at the foot of my garden, and I strongly
recommend your readers to do the same. It mingles charmingly with
the blue Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not, and is equally hardy.”&mdash;S. in <i>Garden</i>.</p>

<p><b>Grape Hyacinth</b>, <i>Muscari</i>.&mdash;These free and hardy little bulbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
are easily naturalised and very handsome, with their little spikes of
flowers of many shades of blue.</p>

<p><b>Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not</b>, <i>Myosotis</i>.&mdash;There is one exotic species, M. dissitiflora,
not inferior in beauty to any of our handsomest native kinds,
and which is well worthy of naturalisation everywhere, thriving best
on moist and sandy soil.<span class="vh"><a name="ill149" id="ill149">ill149</a></span></p></div>

</div></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Molopospermum cicutarium.</b>&mdash;There is a deep green and
fern&ndash;like beauty displayed
profusely by
some of the Umbelliferous
family, but I
have rarely met with
one so remarkably attractive
as this species.
It is a very ornamental
plant, with large,
deeply&ndash;divided leaves
of a lively green colour,
forming a dense irregular
bush. The flowers,
which are insignificant
and of a yellowish&ndash;white
colour, are borne
in small roundish
umbels. Many of the
class, while very elegant,
perish quickly,
get shabby indeed by
the end of June, and
are therefore out of
place in the flower
garden; but this is firm
in character, of a fine rich green, stout yet spreading in habit, growing
more than 3 feet high, and making altogether a most pleasing bush. It
is perfectly hardy, and easily increased by seed or division, but rare as
yet. It loves a deep moist soil, but will thrive in any good garden
soil. It is a fine subject for isolation or grouping with other hardy
and graceful&ndash;leaved Umbelliferous plants.</p>

<p><b>Stock</b>, <i>Matthiola</i>.&mdash;Showy flowers, mostly fragrant, peculiarly well
suited for old ruins, chalk pits, stony banks, etc. Some of the annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
kinds are pretty, and some of the varieties common in gardens assume
a bush&ndash;like character when grown in the positions above named. With
the Stocks may be associated the single rocket (Hesperis matronalis),
which thrives freely in shrubberies and copses.</p>

<p><b>Bee Balm</b>, <i>Monarda</i>.&mdash;Large and very showy herbaceous plants,
with scarlet or purple flowers, conspicuously beautiful in American and
Canadian woods, and capital subjects for naturalisation in woods, copses,

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Mallow</b>, <i>Malva</i>, <i>Alth&oelig;a</i>, <i>Malope</i>, <i>Kitaibelia</i>,
<i>Callirhoe</i>, <i>Sida</i>.&mdash;Plants of several distinct
genera may be included under this type, and
from each very showy and useful things may
be obtained. They are for the most part subjects
which are somewhat too coarse, when
closely examined, to be planted in gardens
generally; but among the taller vegetation in
wild shrubberies, copses, glades in woods, etc.,
they will furnish a magnificent effect. Some
of the Malvas are very showy, vigorous&ndash;growing
plants, mostly with rosy flowers, and would
associate well with our own handsome M.
moschata. The Althæas, close allies of the
common single hollyhock, are very vigorous
and fine for this purpose, as are also the Sidas and Kitaibelia vitifolia.
The Malopes are among the best of the annual subjects for naturalisation.
The Callirhoes are dwarf, handsome trailers, more brilliant than
the others, and the only ones of the type that should be planted on
bare banks or amidst dwarf vegetation, as all the others are of the
most rampant character.</p>

<p><b>Mulgedium Plumieri.</b>&mdash;A herbaceous plant of fine and distinct
port, bearing purplish&ndash;blue blossoms, rather uncommon among its kind.
Till recently it was generally only seen in botanic gardens, but it has,
nevertheless, many merits as a wild garden plant, and for growing in
small groups or single specimens in quiet green corners of pleasure&ndash;grounds
or shrubberies. It does best in rather rich ground, and in
such a position will reward all who plant it, being a really hardy and
long&ndash;lived perennial. The foliage is sometimes over a yard long, and
the flower&ndash;stems attain a height of over six feet in good soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Water Lily</b>, <i>Nymph&oelig;a and Nuphar</i>.&mdash;Two noble North American
plants well deserve naturalisation in our waters, associated with
our own beautiful white and yellow water lilies&mdash;the large Nuphar
advena, which thrusts its great leaves well out of the water in many
parts of North America, and the sweet&ndash;scented Nymphæa odorata, which
floats in crowds on many of the pine&ndash;bordered lakes and lakelets of
New England, to a non&ndash;botanical observer seeming very like our own
water lily.</p>

<p><b>Daffodil</b>, <i>Narcissus</i>.&mdash;Most people have seen the common daffodil
in a semi&ndash;wild state in our woods and copses. Apart from varieties,
there are more than a score distinct species of daffodil that could be
naturalised quite as easily as this in all parts of these islands. We
need hardly suggest how charming these would be, flowering in early
spring and summer in the rougher parts of pleasure grounds, or along
wood&ndash;walks, or any like position.</p>

<p><b>Bitter Vetch</b>, <i>Orobus</i>.&mdash;Banks, grassy unmown margins of
wood&ndash;walks, rocks, fringes of shrubberies, and like places, with
deep and sandy loam, well drained, will grow the beautiful spring
Bitter Vetch or any of its varieties or allies perfectly.</p>

<p><b>Evening Primrose</b>, <i>Enothera</i>.&mdash;Among the largest&ndash;flowered and
handsomest of all known types of herbaceous vegetation. The yellow
species, and varieties like and allied to the common Evening Primrose
(&OElig;. biennis), may be readily naturalised in any position, from a rubbish&ndash;heap
to a nice, open, sunny copse; while such prostrate ones as
&OElig;. marginata and &OElig;. macrocarpa will prove very fine among dwarf herbs
on banks or in open sunny places, in light or calcareous soil. These
noble and delicately&ndash;scented flowers are very easily grown and very
beautiful in any position. They, however, from their height and boldness,
and the freedom with which they grow in almost any soil, are
peculiarly suited for the wild garden, for shrubberies, copses, and the
like, sowing themselves freely.</p>

<p><b>Cotton Thistle</b>, <i>Onopordon</i>.&mdash;Large thistles, with very handsome
hoary and silvery leaves, and purplish flowers on fiercely&ndash;armed stems.
No plants are more noble in port than these, and they thrive freely in
rough open places, rubbish&ndash;heaps, etc., and usually come up freely from
self&ndash;sown seeds.</p>

<p><b>Star of Bethlehem</b>, <i>Ornithogalum</i>.&mdash;Various handsome hardy
species of this genus will thrive as well as the common Star of Bethlehem
in any sunny, grassy places.</p>

<p><b>Creeping Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not</b>, <i>Omphalodes</i>.&mdash;The creeping Forget&ndash;me&ndash;not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Omphalodes verna, is one of the prettiest plants to be naturalised
in woods, copses, or shrubberies, running about with the greatest
freedom in moist soil. It is more compact in habit and lives longer
on good soils than the Forget&ndash;me&ndash;nots, and should be naturalised round
every country place.</p>

<p><b>Wood Sorrel</b>, <i>Oxalis</i>.&mdash;Dwarf plants with clover&ndash;like leaflets and
pretty rosy or yellow flowers. At least two of the species in cultivation,
viz. O. Bowieana and O. floribunda, might be naturalised on sandy
soils amidst vegetation not more than 5 inches or 6 inches high; and
the family is so numerous that probably other members of it will be
found equally free growing.</p></div>

<div class="pbq">

<p><b>Polygonum cuspidatum.</b>&mdash;If, instead of the formal character
of much of our gardening, plants of bold types similar to the above
were introduced along the sides of woodland walks and shrubbery
borders, how much more enjoyable such places would be, as at almost
every step there would be something fresh to attract notice and gratify
the eye, instead of which such parts are generally bare, or given up to
weeds and monotonous rubbish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Pæony.</b>&mdash;Vigorous herbaceous plants, with large and splendid
flowers of various shades of crimson, rosy&ndash;crimson, and white, well
calculated for producing the finest effects in the wild garden. There
are many species and varieties, the flowers of some of the varieties
being very sweet&ndash;scented, double, and among the largest flowers we
know of. Fringes of shrubberies, open glades in woods or copses, and
indeed almost any wild place, may be adorned by them; and they may
also be advantageously grouped or isolated on the grass in the rougher
parts of the pleasure&ndash;ground. I never felt the beauty of the fine
colour of Pæonies till I saw a group of the double scarlet kind flowering
in the long Grass in Oxfordshire. The owner had placed an irregular
group of this plant in an unmown glade, quite away from the garden
proper; and yet, seen from the lawn and garden, the effect was most
brilliant, as may be imagined from the way in which such high colours
tell in the distance. To be able to produce such effects in the early
summer for six weeks or so is a great gain from a landscape point of
view, apart from the immediate beauty of the flowers when seen close
at hand.<span class="vh"><a name="ill153" id="ill153">ill153</a></span></p></div>

Labiates; admirably
suited for the wild
garden. (See p. <a href="#Page_154">154</a>.)</p>
</div></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Poppy</b>, <i>Papaver</i>, <i>in var.</i>&mdash;The huge and flaming Papaver orientale,
P. bracteatum, and P. lateritium, are the most important of this type.
They will thrive and live long in almost any position, but the proper
place for them is in open spots among strong herbaceous plants. For
the wild garden or wilderness the Welsh Poppy (Meconopsis cambrica)
is one of the best plants. It is a cheerful plant at all seasons; perched
on some old dry wall its masses of foliage are
very fresh, but when loaded with a profusion of
large yellow blossoms the plant is strikingly
handsome; it is a determined coloniser, ready to
hold its own under the most adverse circumstances.
Its home is the wall, the rock, and the ruin.
It even surpasses the Wallflower in adapting itself
to strange out&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;way places; it will spring
up in the gravel walk under one’s feet, and seems
quite happy among the boulders in the courtyard.
It looks down on one from crevices in brick walls,
from chinks where one could scarcely introduce
a knife&ndash;blade, and after all it delights most in
shady places. No plant can be better adapted
for naturalising on rough stony banks, old quarries,
gravel pits, dead walls, and similar places, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
its large handsome flowers will lend a charm
to the most uninteresting situations.</p>

<p><b>Phlomis.</b>&mdash;Showy and stately herbaceous
or half&ndash;shrubby plants, with a profusion
of handsome yellow or purplish
flowers. Excellent for naturalisation in
warm open woods, copses, banks, etc., growing
well in ordinary soil.<span class="vh"><a name="ill154" id="ill154">ill154</a></span></p></div>

>The tall Ox&ndash;eye Daisy
(Pyrethrum serotinum).</p>
</div></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Virginian Poke</b>, <i>Phytolacca decandra</i>.&mdash;A
tall, robust perennial, within conspicuous
flowers and long dense spikes of
purplish berries. It will grow anywhere
and in any soil; but is most imposing in
rich deep ones. The berries are relished
by birds. It is fine for association with
the largest and stoutest herbaceous plants
in rough and half&ndash;wild places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Physostegia.</b>&mdash;Tall, erect, and beautiful
herbaceous plants, mostly with delicate
rosy flowers; natives of North
America, thriving in any soil. They are
among the most pleasing things for planting
in half&ndash;wild places, where they will
not spread rampantly, nor perish quickly.</p>

<p><b>Lungwort</b>, <i>Pulmonaria</i>.&mdash;Dwarf
plants of the borage family, with showy
blue or pinkish blossoms. Easily naturalised
in woods or copses, in which position
the common blue one must be familiar to
many in the woods of England and France.
The varieties are common in cottage gardens;
they grow in any soil.</p>

<p><b>The tall Ox&ndash;eye daisy</b>, <i>Pyrethrum
serotinum</i>.&mdash;This fine autumn flowering
plant, for years left in the almost exclusive
possession of the Botanic Gardens,
is one of the handsomest things we have.
It grows 5 or 6 feet high, and flowers
late in the year, when flowers are scarce.
It is very picturesque in habit.</p>

<p><b>Bramble</b>, <i>Rubus</i>.&mdash;Although we have
nearly fifty kinds or reputed kinds of
bramble native in Britain, some of the
exotic species, entirely distinct from our
own, are well worthy of naturalisation
among low shrubs and tall herbaceous
plants. One of the most charming plants
we know for naturalising in shady woods
is the large, white&ndash;flowered Rubus Nutkanus,
with which might be tastefully
associated the deep rose&ndash;coloured Rubus
odoratus, and the early spring&ndash;flowering
R. spectabilis; while the very striking
white&ndash;stemmed R. biflorus is a grand
object for warm slopes, sunny sides of
chalk and gravel pits, etc.</p>

<p><b>The Great Reed</b>; <i>Arundo Donax</i>.&mdash;This
noble reed I do not like to omit here,
it is so beautiful in the southern counties
of England, though in cold soils and hard
winters it may perish. Where the hardier
Bamboos find a place this will be welcome,
though in our country it is only in the
warmer parts that it attains the dignity
of port it possesses in the south of Europe.<span class="vh"><a name="ill155" id="ill155">ill155</a></span></p></div>

(Arundo Donax).</p>
</div></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Rhubarb</b>, <i>Rheum</i>.&mdash;There are several
species of rhubarb in cultivation in addition
to those commonly grown in gardens.
They are much alike in port and
in the size of their leaves, R. palmatum and
Emodi being the most distinct. The rhubarbs
are fine things for association with
large&ndash;leaved herbaceous plants in deep
soils.</p>

<p><b>Rose</b>, <i>Rosa</i>.&mdash;As in the case of
brambles, we have many more kinds of
wild roses in England than is commonly
supposed, but of course nobody ever thinks
of planting such things in gardens or
shrubberies, where such gems as privet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
usually make up the underwood. There are scores of the roses
of northern and temperate countries which would thrive as well in
our woodlands; but as these are not to be obtained in our nurseries,
it is useless to mention them. Any species of rose from a northern
country might be tried; whilst of roses commonly cultivated the
climbing races&mdash;such as the Boursault, Ayrshire, and Sempervirens&mdash;are
the most likely to be satisfactory. The Damask, Alba gallica,
and hybrid China, being hardy and free, would do, as would Felicité
Perpetuelle, Banksiæflora, the Garland roses, Austrian briar, berberifolia,
and microphylla rubra plena. Pruning, or any other attention
after planting, should of course not be thought of in connection with
these. We have seen masses of wild roses the effect of which was
finer than anything we have ever seen in a rosery. Rosa Brunoniana
is a very fine free and hardy species from India.</p>

<p><b>Sea Lavender</b>, <i>Statice</i>.&mdash;Vigorous perennials, with a profusion of
bluish lavender&ndash;coloured bloom, thriving freely on all ordinary garden
soils. S. latifolia, and some of the stronger kinds, thrive in any
position among the medium&ndash;sized herbaceous plants.</p>

<p><b>Spiræa</b>, <i>Spiræa</i>.&mdash;Handsome and usually vigorous herbaceous
plants, with white or rosy flowers, and generally ornamental foliage.
Such beautiful kinds as venusta and palmata it is most desirable to try
in wild places among the stouter and medium&ndash;sized perennials, where
sufficiently plentiful to be spared for this purpose. S. Aruncus is,
perhaps, the finest plant for the wild garden. Mr. Ellam planted out
some spare stock of S. japonica in a wood at Bodorgan, and with
the happiest effect. The plants grow and flower freely, the flowers
appearing a fortnight later in the moist cool wood than on plants of
the same kind on a north garden border; therefore they prolong the
season of this favourite flower. They are planted in an irregular
group, as such things should generally be, the effect being much
better than that obtained by the common dotting plan.</p>

<p><b>Golden Rod</b>, <i>Solidago</i>.&mdash;Tall and vigorous perennials with yellow
flowers, showy when in bloom, and attractive when seen in America in
autumn, mingled with the blue and lilac Asters of that country, but
rarely ornamental as grown in gardens. These, like the Asters, used
to be grown to excess in the old borders; but the only position they
are fit for is in rough wild places, where in many cases it would be
easy, with their aid and that of the Asters, to form that mixture of
Golden Rod and Michaelmas daisies which is one of the prettiest effects
of American vegetation in autumn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Catch&ndash;fly</b>, <i>Silene</i>.&mdash;Dwarf or spreading plants, allied to the pinks,
and generally with white or rosy flowers. The choice mountain kinds,
such as S. Lagascæ, alpestris, Schafta, etc., are among the most charming
subjects that can be naturalised on rocky places or banks, associated
with very dwarf subjects. Such fine annual or biennial kinds as
S. Armeria or S. pendula are among the best for this purpose, and
might be easily established by scattering a few seeds in such places.</p>

<p><b>Bloodwort</b>, <i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i>.&mdash;This little plant, which
abounds in the woods of Canada and North America, and which is
very rarely indeed seen well grown in our gardens, will thrive under
the branches of deciduous trees as well as the winter aconite, and in
spring will produce an effect as beautiful as singular.</p>

<p><b>Squill</b>, <i>Scilla</i>.&mdash;Several kinds of Scilla, closely allied to the
common bluebell, would do quite as well in our woods as that well&ndash;known
native plant, notably S. campanulata, S. bifolia, S. sibirica, etc.
Bifolia and sibirica would be better on sunny banks or sheltered
fringes of shrubberies with a good aspect. The tall kinds would do in
woods or copses like the bluebell. With the dwarfer squills might be
associated the grape hyacinth and the amethyst hyacinth (Hyacinthus
amethystinus).</p>

<p><b>Comfrey</b>, <i>Symphytum</i>.&mdash;Herbaceous plants of the borage order,
usually vigorous, and with handsome blue flowers. One of the handsomest
spring flowers is Symphytum caucasicum, and it is also one of
the easiest things to naturalise, running about with the greatest freedom
in shrubby or any wild places. Coarse kinds, like S. asperrimum
(unfit for garden culture), thrive apace among the largest plants in
wild places, and there look quite beautiful when in flower.</p>

<p><b>Scabious</b>, <i>Scabiosa</i>, <i>Cephalaria</i>, <i>Knautia</i>.&mdash;Sometimes handsome
and usually free&ndash;growing herbaceous plants, bluish, purplish, or
yellowish in tone. Among these may be seen, in botanic and other
gardens, plants suited for naturalisation, but scarcely worthy of a place
in the garden. The fine S. caucasica would thrive amidst coarse
vegetation in good soil, as would the Knautias.</p>

<p><b>Stonecrop</b>, <i>Sedum</i>.&mdash;Minute and usually prostrate plants, mostly
with white, yellow, or rosy flowers, and occurring in multitudes on
most of the mountain chains of northern and temperate countries.
There are few of these interesting and sometimes very pretty plants
that would not grow on the top of an old wall, or thatched house, or
stony bank, or bare ground, as well as our common Stonecrop. All
grow in any soil, are as easily increased as any weed, and grow anywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
if they are not too much overshadowed by trees and coarse vegetation.
Such kinds as S. spurium, S. pulchellum, kamtschaticum, and S.
spectabile are among the most ornamental. The last, being a stout
herbaceous plant, would be worth associating with such in wild places.
There are nearly 100 species of stonecrop in cultivation in Britain.</p>

<p><b>Saxifrage</b>, <i>Saxifraga</i>.&mdash;A very extensive genus of plants, abundantly
distributed on mountains in northern countries. For our
present purpose they may be broadly thrown into five sections&mdash;the
mossy section, represented in Britain by S. hypnoides; the silvery
section, represented by S. Aizoon; the London Pride section, by the
Kerry saxifrages; the Megasea section, by the large cabbage&ndash;leaved S.
crassifolia; and the oppositifolia section, distinguished by its rosy&ndash;purple
flowers. With the exception of the Megasea and oppositifolia sections,
which have rosy flowers, most of the saxifrages have white blossoms
spotted with red; a few are yellow, and all are very hardy, and the
easiest to grow of all alpine flowers. The mossy, silvery, and purple
saxifrages may be naturalised with the greatest ease on bare rocky or
mountainous grounds, amidst dwarf vegetation; but, as the places in
which this kind of ground occurs are comparatively few, the Megaseas,
and the Kerry saxifrages, are probably the most generally useful, as
they can fight their way amongst coarse grass and other common herbs.
There are probably nearly 150 species in cultivation in the botanic
gardens of England, though in many private gardens they are very
little known.</p>

<p><b>Houseleek</b>, <i>Sempervivum</i>.&mdash;Very dwarf and succulent plants,
with their fleshy leaves arranged in dense rosettes, and mostly with
curious but seldom conspicuous flowers, abounding in mountainous
regions, and very hardy. The greater number of these grow quite
as freely as the common Houseleek in any arid soil, and in any position
where the vegetation is not taller than themselves, such as on bare
sandy banks, gravelly heaps, etc. There are about fifty hardy kinds
in cultivation in the gardens in this country.</p>

<p><b>Meadow Rue</b>, <i>Thalictrum</i>.&mdash;Tall and vigorous herbaceous plants,
mostly without any beauty of flower when closely examined, but often
affording a pleasing distant effect when seen in masses, and hence
desirable for this mode of gardening, though seldom suitable for
a position in the garden proper. They grow in any soil, and should
be placed among rank herbs and coarse vegetation, not in the foreground,
which might be occupied by more brilliant subjects. There
are many kinds not differing much in aspect; some of the smaller ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in the way of our own British T. minus, deserve a place among dwarf
vegetation for the elegance of their leaves. With these last may be
associated the Italian Isopyrum thalictroides, which is handsome in
flower and elegant in leaf.</p>

<p><b>Spiderwort</b>, <i>Tradescantia virginica</i>.&mdash;A handsome and distinct
North American perennial, with purple, blue, or white flowers, attaining
a height of 1½ feet or 2 feet. An admirable subject for naturalisation
on almost any soil, thriving perfectly on the wettest and coldest,
and therefore suited for many places where other perennials would
make little progress.</p>

<p><b>Wood Lily</b>, <i>Trillium</i>.&mdash;Very singular and beautiful American
wood plants, of which T. grandiflorum is worthy of special attention,
thriving in shady places in moist rich soils, in woods and copses, where
some vegetable soil has gathered.<span class="vh"><a name="ill159" id="ill159">ill159</a></span></p></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Globe Flower</b>, <i>Trollius</i>.&mdash;Beautiful plants of vigorous habit,
with large handsome flowers, of a fine golden colour, like those of the
buttercups, but turning inwards so as to form an almost round blossom,
quite distinct in aspect. Few subjects are more worthy of a position
in grassy glades where the soil is rich,
although they will grow in ordinary soil.
There are several distinct kinds suitable,
though there is little difference in their
appearance.</p>

<p><b>Tulip</b>, <i>Tulipa</i>.&mdash;Various kinds of
Tulips might be naturalised with advantage
by wood walks and in the rougher
parts of the pleasure grounds. In
such positions they would not attain
such a size as the richly&ndash;fed garden
flowers, but that would make them
none the less attractive to those who
care about the wild garden.</p>

<p><b>Telekia</b>, <i>Telekia cordifolia</i>.&mdash;A
vigorous herbaceous plant, suited for
association with Echinops, Rheum,
and subjects grown for their foliage
and character. It is very free in
growth, and has large foliage and
sunflower&ndash;like flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Flame&ndash;Flower</b>, <i>Tritoma</i>.&mdash;Flame Flowers are occasionally
planted in excess, so as to neutralise the good effect they might otherwise
produce, and they, like many other flowers, have suffered from
being, like soldiers, put in straight lines and in other geometrical formations.
It is only where a fine plant or group of plants is seen in
some green glade that the true beauty of the Flame Flower is seen,
especially at some little distance off. Although not exactly belonging
to the very free&ndash;growing and extremely hardy genera of plants recommended
for the wild garden, they are so free in many soils that they
might with confidence be recommended for that purpose, and our sketch
shows a picturesque group of them planted in this way. It would be
delightful if people having country seats would study more the effects
to be realised from certain types of plants. For instance, a well and
tastefully placed group of these Flame Flowers would for a long time
in autumn be a most effective feature in the landscape of a country
seat; and there are various other plants to which the same remark
applies, though perhaps to none better than these in the later months
of the year.</p></div>

plant, well worth any trouble to establish. Many fail to establish it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc">A tall Mullein.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="pbq">
<p><b>Mullein</b>, <i>Verbascum</i>.&mdash;Verbascum vernale is a noble plant,
which has been slowly spreading in our collections of hardy plants
for some years past, and it is a plant of
peculiar merit. I first saw it in the Garden
of Plants, and brought home some
roots which gave rise to the stock now in
our gardens. Its peculiarities, or rather
its merits, are that it is a true perennial
species&mdash;at least on the warm soils, and
in this respect quite unlike other Mulleins
which are sometimes seen in our gardens,
and oftener in our hedgerows. It also has
the advantage of great height, growing,
as in the specimen shown in our illustration,
to a height of about 10 feet, or
even more. Then there are the large and
green leaves, which come up rather early
and are extremely effective. Finally, the
colour is good and the quantity of yellow
flowers with purplish filaments that are
borne on one of these great branching
panicles is something enormous. The
use of such a plant cannot be difficult
to define, it being so good in form and so
distinct in habit. For the back part of
a mixed border, for grouping with other
plants of remarkable size or form of
foliage, or for placing here and there in
open spaces among shrubs, it is well
suited. A bold group of it, arranged on
the Grass by itself, in deep, light, and
well&ndash;dressed soil, would be effective in a
picturesque garden. It is also known in
gardens by the name of Verbascum Chaixii, which name, we believe,
was given to it at Kew.</p>

<p><b>Periwinkle</b>, <i>Vinca</i>.&mdash;Trailing plants, with glossy foliage and
handsome blue flowers, well known in gardens. They are admirable
plants for naturalisation, growing in any position, shady or sunny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
There are variously&ndash;coloured and very pretty varieties of V. minor,
while the variegated forms of both species are handsome, and may be
naturalised like the green kinds.</p>

<p><b>Speedwell</b>, <i>Veronica</i>.&mdash;Herbaceous plants, usually rather tall
(1½ feet to 3 feet), in some cases dwarf and neat alpine plants with
blue flowers in various shades; are among the hardiest of plants, and
will grow in any soil. All the taller kinds are admirably suited for
naturalisation among long grass and other herbaceous vegetation. A
great number that are in cultivation in borders are only fit for this
purpose. The dwarf kinds are equally suitable for bare places, or
among other dwarf plants.</p>

<p><b>Violet</b>, <i>Viola</i>.&mdash;A numerous race of dwarf and interesting plants,
thriving freely in our climate, in half&ndash;shady places, rocky spots or
banks, fringes of shrubberies, or almost any position. The very handsome
bird’s&ndash;foot violet of N. America (V. pedata) would thrive in sandy
level places or on rocky banks. In this family occur a good many
kinds, such as V. canadensis, which, not being fragrant, or not possessing
sufficient charms to ensure their general cultivation in gardens, are
peculiarly suited for this sort of gardening. Our own sweet violet
should be abundantly naturalised wherever it does not occur in a
wild state.</p>

<p><b>Adam’s&ndash;Needle</b>, <i>Yucca</i>.&mdash;Although these scarcely come into this
selection, yet their fine habit and their hardiness give them a charm
for us even in a wild garden. A legitimate aim, on the part of any
one carrying out this to any extent, would be to try and develop a
sub&ndash;tropical aspect of vegetation in certain places. In such a case the
Yuccas could not be dispensed with. The free&ndash;flowering kinds (Y.
flaccida and Y. filamentosa) should not be omitted, as they are more
likely to spread and increase than the larger ones; all such plants are
better held together in groups.</p></div>

<p class="pn">As it is desirable to know
how to procure as well as
how to select the best kinds,
a few words on the first
subject may not be amiss
here.</p>

<p>A very important point
is the getting of a stock of
plants to begin with. In country or other places
where many good old border flowers remain in the
cottage gardens, many species may be collected
therein. A series of nursery beds should be formed
in some by&ndash;place in which such subjects could be
increased to any desired degree. Free&ndash;growing
spring&ndash;flowers like Aubrietia, Alyssum, and Iberis,
may be multiplied to any extent by division or cuttings.
Numbers of kinds may be raised from seed sown rather thinly in drills, in
nursery beds in the open air. The catalogues should be searched every
Spring for suitable subjects. The best time for sowing is the Spring, but
any time during the Summer will do. Many perennials and bulbs must
be bought in nurseries and increased as well as may be in nursery beds.
As to soil, etc., the best way is to avoid the trouble of preparing it
except for specially interesting plants. The great point is to adapt the

as to allow the planted subjects to become well established. The ground
is so dried, and exhausted and impoverished in some woodland places
with coarse weeds, that so much preparation is necessary.</p>

<p><i>Plants for Naturalisation beneath specimen Trees on Lawns, etc.</i></p>

<p>Where, as is frequently the case, the branches of trees, both
evergreen and deciduous, sweep the turf&mdash;and this, as a rule, they
should be allowed to do where they are planted in ornamental
grounds&mdash;a great number of pretty spring flowers may be naturalised
beneath the branches, where they thrive without attention. It is
chiefly in the case of deciduous trees that this could be done; but
even in the case of conifers and evergreens some graceful objects might
be dotted beneath the outermost points of their lower branches. However,
it is the specimen deciduous tree that offers us the best opportunities
in this way. We know that a great number of our spring flowers
and hardy bulbs mature their foliage and go to rest early in the year.
They require light and sun in spring, which they obtain abundantly
under the deciduous tree; they have time to flower and develop their
leaves under it before the foliage of the tree appears; then, as the
summer heats approach, they are gradually overshadowed by a cool
canopy, and go to rest undisturbed; but, the leaves of the trees once
fallen, they soon begin to appear again and cover the ground with
beauty.</p>

<p>An example or two will perhaps explain the matter more fully.
Take the case of, say, a spreading old specimen of any summer&ndash;leafing
tree. Scatter a few tufts of the winter Aconite beneath it, and leave
them alone. In a very few years they will have covered the ground;
every year afterwards they will spread a golden carpet beneath the
tree; and when it fades there will be no eyesore from decaying leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
as there would be on a border&mdash;no necessity for replacing the plants
with others; the tree puts forth its leaves, covering the ground till
Autumn, and in early spring we again see our little friend in all the
vigour of his glossy leaves and golden buttons. In this way this
pretty spring flower may be seen to much greater advantage, in a
much more pleasing position than in the ordinary way of putting it in
patches and rings in beds or borders, and with a tithe of the trouble.
There are many other subjects of which the same is true. We have
only to imagine this done in a variety of cases to see to what a beautiful
and novel result it would lead. Given the bright blue Apennine Anemone
under one tree, the spring Snowflake under another, the delicate
blue and pencilled Crocuses, and so on, we should have a spring garden
of the most beautiful kind. The same plan could be carried out under
the branches of a grove as well as of specimen trees. Very attractive
mixed plantations might be made by dotting tall subjects like the
large Jonquil (Narcissus odorus) among dwarf spreading plants like
the Anemone, and also by mixing dwarf plants of various colours:
diversely coloured varieties of the same species of Anemone, for
example.</p>

<p>Omitting the various pretty British plants that would thrive in the
positions indicated&mdash;these are not likely to be unknown to the reader
interested in such matters&mdash;and confining the selection to dwarf, hardy,
exotic flowers alone, the following are selected as among the most
suitable for such arrangements as that just described, with some little
attention as to the season of flowering and the kind of soil required by
some rather uncommon species. A late&ndash;flowering kind, for example,
should be planted under late&ndash;leafing trees, or towards the points of
their branches, so that they might not be obscured by the leaves of
the tree before perfecting their flowers.</p>

<h3>RABBITS AND WOODS.</h3>

<p>This sad subject has been kept for the last, as the only disagreeable
one in connection with the wild garden. All I have to say of
it is, there should be no rabbits in the wild garden; but the following
suggestions may prove useful.</p>

<p>The subject should be presented in a practical light to landowners
and preservers of game, and if it can be shown that the preservation,
or rather toleration, of rabbits on an estate is a dead loss both to the
proprietor and his tenants, probably more active measures would be
taken for their extermination. It is incalculable the injury they do to
young trees alone; indeed, where they prevail there is no chance of
getting up cover except at an extravagant cost. Hares are less
destructive, if they damage trees at all; and it is said by experienced
gamekeepers that they never thrive so well where rabbits abound.
And as regards pheasants, they drive them away by eating down the
evergreen cover so necessary to their existence in the way of shelter in
winter. Pheasants will not remain in a wood where there is not
shelter of this kind; and nothing are they more partial to than the
Holly, which ought to abound in every wood, but which the rabbits
destroy first. Here are two sorts of game&mdash;hares and pheasants&mdash;which
many can never have enough of, and the existence of which is directly
interfered with by the rabbits; they should be encouraged at the
expense of the latter&mdash;not to speak of the expense incurred year after
year making up losses in plantation, and the expense of wire&ndash;netting
and labour, etc., in protecting the trees. The extermination of rabbits
in this country is not such a difficult matter as might be imagined.
When it was determined here a few years since to reduce their numbers
to a minimum on the farm lands and woods, it did not require more
than a couple of years to do so by shooting and ferreting during the
season; and they are now principally confined to one part of the
estate&mdash;an extensive tract of waste land not of much use for any other
purpose. I feel pretty certain that a few active poachers would undertake
to clear an estate of its rabbits in a marvellously short time, and
would be glad to pay a handsome consideration for the privilege of
doing so. In whatever degree rabbits contribute to our food supply&mdash;and
it is not much&mdash;they certainly destroy a great quantity of our corn
crops, and are no profit to gentlemen or game preservers, and there is
therefore no excuse for their existence.</p>

<p>Hungry rabbits, like hungry dogs or starving men, will eat almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
anything that can be masticated and swallowed. Rabbits, as a rule,
prefer to nibble over a pasture that contains short, sweet, wholesome
grass, and a proportion of clover, dandelion, and daisies, but in and
about woods where rabbits are numerous, the grass, from being closely
and constantly eaten off, gradually disappears, and at the approach of
winter is succeeded by moss, a very cold, watery, and innutritious
substitute; then rabbits are driven to seek food from other sources
than grass, and the bark of small trees, the leaves, stalks, and bark of
shrubs, and the protruding roots of forest trees, are eaten almost indiscriminately.
Amongst evergreen shrubs, rhododendrons and box are
generally avoided, but I have known newly&ndash;planted hybrid rhododendrons
to be partly eaten by rabbits. The elder is distasteful, and
American azaleas are avoided. I have frequently seen Yew trees
barked; mahonias are devoured in these woods as soon as planted;
and periwinkle, which is named amongst rabbit&ndash;proof plants, is generally
eaten to the ground in severe weather. Some of the bulbs and flowering
plants named by your correspondent may well escape in winter,
because they are not seen above ground, and where they grow, other
more agreeable herbage appears, so their immunity consists in being
inaccessible in a hungry time. Where rabbits are permitted, the fact
that they require food daily, like other creatures, should be recognised.
In the absence of wholesome food, they will eat simply what they can
get. A certain portion of grass land should be retained for them and
managed accordingly; a few acres might be wired round, or, to be
more explicit, surrounded with wire&ndash;netting, to the exclusion of rabbits,
until the approach of wintry weather, when it could be thrown open
for them. If this cannot be done, and frosty weather sets in, when
the mischief to shrubs is consummated, trimmings of quick hedges
should be scattered about, and an allowance of turnips, carrots, or
mangold wurzel made and doled out daily in bad weather. In my
experience rabbits prefer newly planted trees and shrubs to those
established. I have even had the fronds of newly&ndash;planted Athyrium
Filix&ndash;f&oelig;mina eaten, while other ferns have been untouched. There is
one hint I may give your rabbit&ndash;preserving readers: certain breeds of
wild rabbits are much more prone to bark trees than others. The
barking of trees is an acquired propensity more common to north&ndash;country
rabbits than others. I should advise the destruction of those
rabbits whose propensity for shrubs is very marked, and try warren or
common rabbits from the south of England; but the best advice I can
give is to have no rabbits at all.&mdash;J. S.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>A correspondent who has given much attention to the subject
(Salmoniceps) gives the following, as among the most rabbit&ndash;proof of
plants:&mdash;“Most of the Lily family are,” he says, “rejected by them,
including Daffodils, Tulips, Snowdrops, Snowflakes, Lilies, Day Lilies,
Asphodels, and others, and they cannot be too extensively planted;
but even in that tribe the Crocus (which is also named in the article
in question) is greedily devoured. I gave&mdash;in an early number of
your paper (see pp. 9 and 88, Vol. I.)&mdash;a list of all rabbit&ndash;proof trees,
shrubs, and flowers then known to me, and I regret that, though keeping
a watch upon the subject, I have not been able to add a single
species to the list given below.”</p>

<p class="p1">Lists, however, and considerations of the above sort, are a poor
substitute for what is really required in such cases&mdash;the extermination
of pests which are destructive alike to field crops, to trees and shrubs,
and to plants, and which offer at best a very scanty return for the
havoc they commit.</p>
